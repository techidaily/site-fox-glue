What is new about the past couple of years’ experience regarding buzzwords in their profusion? That is thanks to the COVID 19 pandemic which rather contrary to common-sense expectations acted as a catalyst to processes that were either yet to be hatched or were lying dormant. The world of tech has been at the forefront of such unfolding and hence words like Artificial Intelligence, Distributed Cloud, Hyper Automation, Metaverse, Everything as a service (XaaS), Quantum Computing, Cybersecurity Mesh, and many, many more have gained wide currency rather quickly. So let us begin at the beginning by understanding what it is that we talk about when we are talking about Metaverse nowadays.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-device.jpg"                      alt="Metaverse Device"                ></p><p>Source: thenextweb.com</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What Is Metaverse Technology?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Must-Have Metaverse Devices You Should Know</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Eye on the Future: Where Will Metaverse Go?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Metaverse-Technology"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Metaverse-Technology" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is Metaverse Technology?"></a>Part 1: What Is Metaverse Technology?</h2><p>The word Metaverse might be a hot topic today but it has been around for quite a significant amount of time now. In his 1992 sci-fi novel “Snow Crash”, author Neal Stephenson coined the term first. The word referred to the author’s projection of a world that is a 3D simulation per excellence populated by lifelike virtual avatars. The world has moved on since 1992 and so the idea of Metaverse has undergone further developments as well. Tech milestones like augmented reality, virtual reality, 3D holographic avatars, and advanced communication techniques, all forayed into the arena.</p><p>So yes, Metaverse is quite literally a digital universe that is given body by the joint efforts made by the above-noted technologies. Here users, or more precisely, their digital avatars, can live in the truest sense of the word. As of now, using an assortment of metaverse devices, users can work, play, socialize in this virtual realm. They can even visit concerts, join conferences or take virtual trips around the Metaverse using this technology.

But whatever the path that the technology takes, it is beyond dispute that the metaverse is here to stay. And this makes it mandatory that one gets acquainted with the gears that are needed to undertake this journey.

What is new about the past couple of years’ experience regarding buzzwords in their profusion? That is thanks to the COVID 19 pandemic which rather contrary to common-sense expectations acted as a catalyst to processes that were either yet to be hatched or were lying dormant. The world of tech has been at the forefront of such unfolding and hence words like Artificial Intelligence, Distributed Cloud, Hyper Automation, Metaverse, Everything as a service (XaaS), Quantum Computing, Cybersecurity Mesh, and many, many more have gained wide currency rather quickly. So let us begin at the beginning by understanding what it is that we talk about when we are talking about Metaverse nowadays.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-device.jpg"                      alt="Metaverse Device"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://otszone.ots7.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4713322&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://green.ots7.com/screenshots/OtsAV/OtsAVRadio1.90-300x188.jpg"                      border="0"                >OtsAV Radio Webcaster</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Source: thenextweb.com</p><h4 id="In-this-article-1"><a href="#In-this-article-1" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What Is Metaverse Technology?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Must-Have Metaverse Devices You Should Know</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Eye on the Future: Where Will Metaverse Go?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Metaverse-Technology-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Metaverse-Technology-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is Metaverse Technology?"></a>Part 1: What Is Metaverse Technology?</h2><p>The word Metaverse might be a hot topic today but it has been around for quite a significant amount of time now. In his 1992 sci-fi novel “Snow Crash”, author Neal Stephenson coined the term first. The word referred to the author’s projection of a world that is a 3D simulation per excellence populated by lifelike virtual avatars. The world has moved on since 1992 and so the idea of Metaverse has undergone further developments as well. Tech milestones like augmented reality, virtual reality, 3D holographic avatars, and advanced communication techniques, all forayed into the arena.</p><p>So yes, Metaverse is quite literally a digital universe that is given body by the joint efforts made by the above-noted technologies. Here users, or more precisely, their digital avatars, can live in the truest sense of the word. As of now, using an assortment of metaverse devices, users can work, play, socialize in this virtual realm. They can even visit concerts, join conferences or take virtual trips around the Metaverse using this technology.

What is new about the past couple of years’ experience regarding buzzwords in their profusion? That is thanks to the COVID 19 pandemic which rather contrary to common-sense expectations acted as a catalyst to processes that were either yet to be hatched or were lying dormant. The world of tech has been at the forefront of such unfolding and hence words like Artificial Intelligence, Distributed Cloud, Hyper Automation, Metaverse, Everything as a service (XaaS), Quantum Computing, Cybersecurity Mesh, and many, many more have gained wide currency rather quickly.

In his 1992 sci-fi novel “Snow Crash”, author Neal Stephenson coined the term first. The word referred to the author’s projection of a world that is a 3D simulation per excellence populated by lifelike virtual avatars. The world has moved on since 1992 and so the idea of Metaverse has undergone further developments as well. Tech milestones like augmented reality, virtual reality, 3D holographic avatars, and advanced communication techniques, all forayed into the arena.</p><p>So yes, Metaverse is quite literally a digital universe that is given body by the joint efforts made by the above-noted technologies. Here users, or more precisely, their digital avatars, can live in the truest sense of the word. As of now, using an assortment of metaverse devices, users can work, play, socialize in this virtual realm. They can even visit concerts, join conferences or take virtual trips around the Metaverse using this technology.

Some of these platforms are:</p><h3 id="1-Meta-2"><a href="#1-Meta-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Meta"></a>1. Meta</h3><p>Apart from the acquisition of Oculus, a company that manufactures Virtual Reality (VR) headsets, in 2014, the tech mammoth Facebook has made public its immense interest in virtual reality by rebranding itself as Meta this year. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, voiced his support for the Metaverse when, while declaring the rebranding, he said, “The next platform and medium will be a much more immersive and embodied internet where you’re in the experience, not just looking at it, and we call this the metaverse.” Meta has delivered on this by unveiling the Horizon Workrooms beta, a virtual meeting area designed for co-workers to hold their meetings using a metaverse device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-device-meta.jpg"                      alt="metaverse device meta"                ></p><h3 id="2-Microsoft-2"><a href="#2-Microsoft-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Microsoft"></a>2. Microsoft</h3><p>It is another tech giant that has advanced considerably in this direction when it revealed its very own hologram technology back in 2019. Microsoft holograms can change someone into a digital speaker of an alien language. The Microsoft Mesh platform has since then been busy developing mixed and extended reality applications. Microsoft has also made known its intention of developing Microsoft Teams along these lines in 2022. Collaboration with the U.S. army is also underway aimed at designing an augmented reality Hololens 2 hardware that will help soldiers train better. Microsoft’s Xbox Live must be accounted for here as well as it establishes connections between millions of video gamers from around the globe. The company would also start working on the development of 3D hyper-real spaces for the world of retail and general workplaces.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4615471&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/affiliate-image/affiliate_banners_en/max_782x90.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Epic-Games-2"><a href="#3-Epic-Games-2" class="headerlink" title="3.

As long as the ethical underpinnings of such a development get predominant over the technology part, we must welcome such efforts. As some reports on the prevailing sexist atmospheres in some metaverse spaces have underlined, the realm needs regulations. The impact on the environment, data privacy are some other issues that we must come to terms with. Beyond these, the possibilities that metaverse technology has already pointed at herald a future that is every bit worth experiencing.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>The concept of metaverse needs not be demonized at this early stage. In fact, the very fact that the idea is still inchoate makes us agents of deciding whether we want to create a bubble universe that keeps out the digital proletariat or a universe that can get past the constraints of time and space to give a new lease of human creativity. But whatever the path that the technology takes, it is beyond dispute that the metaverse is here to stay. And this makes it mandatory that one gets acquainted with the gears that are needed to undertake this journey. With a flurry of brands offering good products, the only thing one needs to get right is the basics of such devices.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Buzzwords are nothing new. What is new about the past couple of years’ experience regarding buzzwords in their profusion? That is thanks to the COVID 19 pandemic which rather contrary to common-sense expectations acted as a catalyst to processes that were either yet to be hatched or were lying dormant. The world of tech has been at the forefront of such unfolding and hence words like Artificial Intelligence, Distributed Cloud, Hyper Automation, Metaverse, Everything as a service (XaaS), Quantum Computing, Cybersecurity Mesh, and many, many more have gained wide currency rather quickly. So let us begin at the beginning by understanding what it is that we talk about when we are talking about Metaverse nowadays.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-device.jpg"                      alt="Metaverse Device"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://funwhole.sjv.io/c/5597632/1702887/17189" target="_top" id="1702887"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17189-1702887"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1000"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1702887/17189"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Source: thenextweb.com</p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What Is Metaverse Technology?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Must-Have Metaverse Devices You Should Know</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Eye on the Future: Where Will Metaverse Go?</a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=12653808&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/wt-500x500.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Metaverse-Technology-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Metaverse-Technology-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is Metaverse Technology?"></a>Part 1: What Is Metaverse Technology?</h2><p>The word Metaverse might be a hot topic today but it has been around for quite a significant amount of time now. In his 1992 sci-fi novel “Snow Crash”, author Neal Stephenson coined the term first. The word referred to the author’s projection of a world that is a 3D simulation per excellence populated by lifelike virtual avatars. The world has moved on since 1992 and so the idea of Metaverse has undergone further developments as well. Tech milestones like augmented reality, virtual reality, 3D holographic avatars, and advanced communication techniques, all forayed into the arena.</p><p>So yes, Metaverse is quite literally a digital universe that is given body by the joint efforts made by the above-noted technologies. Here users, or more precisely, their digital avatars, can live in the truest sense of the word. As of now, using an assortment of metaverse devices, users can work, play, socialize in this virtual realm. They can even visit concerts, join conferences or take virtual trips around the Metaverse using this technology.

Meta</h3><p>Apart from the acquisition of Oculus, a company that manufactures Virtual Reality (VR) headsets, in 2014, the tech mammoth Facebook has made public its immense interest in virtual reality by rebranding itself as Meta this year. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, voiced his support for the Metaverse when, while declaring the rebranding, he said, “The next platform and medium will be a much more immersive and embodied internet where you’re in the experience, not just looking at it, and we call this the metaverse.” Meta has delivered on this by unveiling the Horizon Workrooms beta, a virtual meeting area designed for co-workers to hold their meetings using a metaverse device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-device-meta.jpg"                      alt="metaverse device meta"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38729081&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://website-prod.cache.wpscdn.com/img/wps-spreadsheet-free-excel-editor-online-offline-1x.93e269d.png"                      border="0"                ><br>WPS Office Premium ( File Recovery, Photo Scanning, Convert PDF)–Yearly</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Microsoft-3"><a href="#2-Microsoft-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

Microsoft holograms can change someone into a digital speaker of an alien language. The Microsoft Mesh platform has since then been busy developing mixed and extended reality applications. Microsoft has also made known its intention of developing Microsoft Teams along these lines in 2022. Collaboration with the U.S. army is also underway aimed at designing an augmented reality Hololens 2 hardware that will help soldiers train better. Microsoft’s Xbox Live must be accounted for here as well as it establishes connections between millions of video gamers from around the globe. The company would also start working on the development of 3D hyper-real spaces for the world of retail and general workplaces.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027209/17108" target="_top" id="2027209"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2027209"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2027209/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Epic-Games-3"><a href="#3-Epic-Games-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

As long as the ethical underpinnings of such a development get predominant over the technology part, we must welcome such efforts. As some reports on the prevailing sexist atmospheres in some metaverse spaces have underlined, the realm needs regulations. The impact on the environment, data privacy are some other issues that we must come to terms with. Beyond these, the possibilities that metaverse technology has already pointed at herald a future that is every bit worth experiencing.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>The concept of metaverse needs not be demonized at this early stage. In fact, the very fact that the idea is still inchoate makes us agents of deciding whether we want to create a bubble universe that keeps out the digital proletariat or a universe that can get past the constraints of time and space to give a new lease of human creativity. But whatever the path that the technology takes, it is beyond dispute that the metaverse is here to stay. And this makes it mandatory that one gets acquainted with the gears that are needed to undertake this journey. With a flurry of brands offering good products, the only thing one needs to get right is the basics of such devices.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"

In the battle of podcast vs. YouTube, which one would you pick? One or both? You may upload videos on YouTube or create podcasts.</p><p>One reason to use Spotify for podcasts is that it’s a global platform, meaning your podcast can be heard by a large audience worldwide.</p><p>Spotify is a popular platform, so listeners will likely discover your podcast through them. Putting out a video on YouTube is more work than creating a podcast; however, it may be rewarding. Read and find which one is the best!</p><h2 id="A-Brief-Overview-of-Podcast-vs-YouTube"><a href="#A-Brief-Overview-of-Podcast-vs-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="A Brief Overview of Podcast vs. YouTube"></a>A Brief Overview of Podcast vs. YouTube</h2><p>There’s no denying that YouTube is one of the most popular online platforms. Millions of people use it daily to watch videos on everything from current events to how-to guides.</p><p>But YouTube isn’t the only game in town regarding online video.</p><p>Podcasts are also becoming increasingly popular, especially among people who commute or have long car journeys. So, which is better - YouTube or podcasts?</p><p>There’s a massive range of content available on YouTube. No matter your interests, you’re sure to find something to watch. YouTube videos are usually shorter than podcasts, so they’re perfect for busy people who don’t have time to commit to an extended episode.</p><p>You can watch YouTube videos on your phone or tablet, even if you’re not connected to the internet. So it is perfect for when you’re on the go. Now talking about podcasts, they can be downloaded and listened to offline, so you can listen even if you’re not connected to the internet.</p><p>The difference between podcasts and YouTube is that Podcasts are usually longer than YouTube videos. So they can be great for getting in-depth information on a topic. In addition, you may listen to podcasts while doing other things, such as driving or cooking.</p><p>Lately, investing your time in creating a meaningful video podcast makes more sense. The editing process of a podcast will be simpler than editing a YouTube video. You’ll only have to focus on audio when working on the podcast.</p><p>On the other hand, YouTube will require more attention to detail while working on the video, audio, subtitle, and description. Some may simultaneously work on videos and podcasts, creating content for both platforms. Many creators upload videos on YouTube and convert them into podcasts.</p><p>| |  Podcast                                                 | YouTube                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |<br>| ———————————————————- | —————————————————————————————————————————————————– | ———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————- |<br>| What is it                                                 | Podcasts are audio streaming services that let you listen to episodic content, such as interviews or news reports, on your computer or mobile device. | YouTube is a video-sharing website and online video platform.

Podcasts are more convenient to listen to while doing other things, such as commuting or working out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/podcast-vs-youtube-1.jpg"                      alt="funny kids videos on youtube can get millions of views"                ></p><p>On the downside, podcasts generally don’t have the same production value as YouTube videos, so they can sometimes feel “cheap” or “amateurish.” On the other hand, YouTube videos usually have better production value than podcasts due to content creators’ higher level of investment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/podcast-vs-youtube-2.jpg"                      alt="apple has launched podcasts in competition with spotify"                ></p><p>YouTube also offers a more diverse range of content than podcasts since anyone can upload a video. However, YouTube videos can be much more explanatory than podcasts, making them less convenient to consume.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/podcast-vs-youtube-3.jpg"                      alt="writing a good description with tags will help get views"                ></p><h2 id="Can-You-Transform-a-Podcast-Into-a-YouTube-Video-or-Vice-Versa"><a href="#Can-You-Transform-a-Podcast-Into-a-YouTube-Video-or-Vice-Versa" class="headerlink" title="Can You Transform a Podcast Into a YouTube Video or Vice Versa?"></a>Can You Transform a Podcast Into a YouTube Video or Vice Versa?</h2><p>Many love podcasts.

It turns out you can! There are a few different options, so you don’t have to choose between a podcast or YouTube.</p><p>If you have a podcast that you want to turn into a YouTube video, one option is to record the audio from the podcast and turn it into a video file. You can then upload this video to YouTube and share it.</p><p>Another option is to use screen capture software to record your podcast as you’re playing it. This will give you a video of the audio and any visuals that may be part of the show. You can then upload this video to YouTube and share it.</p><p>If you have a YouTube video that you want to turn into a podcast, one option is to download the audio from the video and transform it into an MP3 file. You can then share this MP3 file with your favorite podcasting platform.</p><p>Another option is to use screen capture software to record the video as you’re playing it. This will give you an audio file of the video and any visuals that may be part of the show.

Meanwhile, use the audio to upload as a podcast. Then, your listeners and viewers can watch the video and listen to the podcast on the go.</p><p>And if you have a podcast that’s doing well, you can create a YouTube video series based on it. Alternatively, if you have a popular YouTube channel, you can create a podcast based on your videos.</p><h2 id="What-Are-the-Pros-Cons-of-a-YouTube-Channel-and-Podcast-Episode"><a href="#What-Are-the-Pros-Cons-of-a-YouTube-Channel-and-Podcast-Episode" class="headerlink" title="What Are the Pros &amp; Cons of a YouTube Channel and Podcast Episode"></a>What Are the Pros &amp; Cons of a YouTube Channel and Podcast Episode</h2><p><strong>Pros and Cons of a YouTube video:</strong></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>No physical office is required.

To know which is better, podcast or YouTube, you may have to learn about the statistics. Podcasts are seeing a resurgence in popularity, while YouTube is still the top video site in the world. About 383.7 million podcast listeners globally as of November 2022.</p><p>Out of these podcast listeners, 50% are between 12-34 in age, and 43% are between 35-54 in age. In Canada, 1 in 3 people listens to a podcast. The country recorded the highest viewership in the world in 2022. Australian and US podcast listeners are at the top in 2022.</p><p>This number is at 2.1 billion monthly active users for YouTube based all around the world. The global audience of 95% of YouTube viewers is adults between 18 and 29.</p><p>Talking about ads, 80% of podcast listeners believe product ads in a podcast lead to purchase. YouTube also has massive ad growth of 5% ad revenue growth to $7.3 billion in the second quarter of 2022.</p><h2 id="Opportunities-Challenges-for-Podcasts-and-YouTube"><a href="#Opportunities-Challenges-for-Podcasts-and-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Opportunities &amp; Challenges for Podcasts and YouTube"></a>Opportunities &amp; Challenges for Podcasts and YouTube</h2><p>There are many opportunities and challenges for creating podcasts and YouTube videos. Podcasts can be a great way to share your knowledge and stories with others while also building an audience.</p><p>However, making an exciting podcast is tricky, and creating a good one takes time and effort. One of the biggest challenges is finding a good topic. In addition, you need to be passionate about what you’re talking about if you want your podcast to be successful.</p><p>Another challenge is finding the right audio or video equipment. If you don’t have the right tools, your podcast will sound poor, and your videos will look amateurish. In addition, many podcasters and YouTubers may struggle to edit videos initially. As a result, people don’t spend much time on their channels.</p><p>There are also many opportunities for making money from podcasts and YouTube videos. For example, you can sell advertising space, sell merchandise, or get sponsorships. Furthermore, you may get famous and get invited to events.</p><h2 id="Key-Factors-to-Consider-When-Deciding-How-to-Share-Content"><a href="#Key-Factors-to-Consider-When-Deciding-How-to-Share-Content" class="headerlink" title="Key Factors to Consider When Deciding How to Share Content"></a>Key Factors to Consider When Deciding How to Share Content</h2><p>When it comes to deciding how to share your content on podcast vs. YouTube, there are a few things you’ll want to consider.</p><ol><li><strong>What’s the goal?</strong> The first thing you’ll want to determine is the goal of sharing your content. Are you looking to build an audience for your podcast or video channel, generate leads for your business, or simply leave a meaningful legacy behind?</li><li>The second factor you’ll want to consider is <strong>your audience size and engagement</strong>. How many people will actually listen to or watch your content? And how engaged are they with it? Do they regularly share it on social media or respond positively to reviews?</li><li><strong>What format should your content be in?</strong> For example, should it be an audio-only podcast, a video-only channel, or a mixture of both? And what style should it be in – formal or informal?</li><li><strong>You’ll need to ensure that your content is creative and innovative.</strong> Is something unique about your topic that will make it stand out from the crowd? Or do you have new ideas that could be valuable for others to learn about?</li><li><strong>Pick the right niche.</strong> For example, a cooking show may not work well as a podcast, but it could be great as a YouTube series.</li><li><strong>You’ll want to promote your content in the appropriate channels.</strong> If you’re creating a YouTube series based on your podcast, promote it on your podcast platform and your YouTube channel.</li><li><strong>Focus on building skills.</strong> If your current skill level is at a beginner level, you may do well making less complex videos and podcasts. Using tools such as Filmora may help you create and edit videos.</li><li><strong>How you create and promote content may also depend on your budget.</strong> So be mindful of your budget and expand when you receive the proper engagement.</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068425/7443" target="_top" id="2068425"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068425"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068425/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>So, which is excellent in the battle of podcast vs. YouTube video?

Podcasts are more convenient to listen to while doing other things, such as commuting or working out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/podcast-vs-youtube-1.jpg"                      alt="funny kids videos on youtube can get millions of views"                ></p><p>On the downside, podcasts generally don’t have the same production value as YouTube videos, so they can sometimes feel “cheap” or “amateurish.” On the other hand, YouTube videos usually have better production value than podcasts due to content creators’ higher level of investment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/podcast-vs-youtube-2.jpg"                      alt="apple has launched podcasts in competition with spotify"                ></p><p>YouTube also offers a more diverse range of content than podcasts since anyone can upload a video. However, YouTube videos can be much more explanatory than podcasts, making them less convenient to consume.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/podcast-vs-youtube-3.jpg"                      alt="writing a good description with tags will help get views"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2090698/16836" target="_top" id="2090698"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2090698"                      border="0" alt="" width="720" height="300"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Can-You-Transform-a-Podcast-Into-a-YouTube-Video-or-Vice-Versa-1"><a href="#Can-You-Transform-a-Podcast-Into-a-YouTube-Video-or-Vice-Versa-1" class="headerlink" title="Can You Transform a Podcast Into a YouTube Video or Vice Versa?"></a>Can You Transform a Podcast Into a YouTube Video or Vice Versa?</h2><p>Many love podcasts. They have the convenience of being able to create and listen to podcasts on the go. And there are also a lot of people who love YouTube videos. They love the visuals and the ability to watch their favorite videos whenever possible.</p><p>So, what if you could combine these two? Can you transform a podcast into a YouTube video or vice versa? It turns out you can! There are a few different options, so you don’t have to choose between a podcast or YouTube.</p><p>If you have a podcast that you want to turn into a YouTube video, one option is to record the audio from the podcast and turn it into a video file. You can then upload this video to YouTube and share it.</p><p>Another option is to use screen capture software to record your podcast as you’re playing it. This will give you a video of the audio and any visuals that may be part of the show. You can then upload this video to YouTube and share it.</p><p>If you have a YouTube video that you want to turn into a podcast, one option is to download the audio from the video and transform it into an MP3 file. You can then share this MP3 file with your favorite podcasting platform.</p><p>Another option is to use screen capture software to record the video as you’re playing it. This will give you an audio file of the video and any visuals that may be part of the show. You can then upload this audio file to your favorite podcasting platform and share it with the world.</p><p>Lastly, you may present a podcast on your webcam and record the video and audio for YouTube. Meanwhile, use the audio to upload as a podcast. Then, your listeners and viewers can watch the video and listen to the podcast on the go.</p><p>And if you have a podcast that’s doing well, you can create a YouTube video series based on it. Alternatively, if you have a popular YouTube channel, you can create a podcast based on your videos.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=40085955&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/f702defbc67edb455949f46babab0c18/products/2_logo9.png"                      border="0"                >FX PRO (Gold Robot + Silver Robot(Basic Package))</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-Are-the-Pros-Cons-of-a-YouTube-Channel-and-Podcast-Episode-1"><a href="#What-Are-the-Pros-Cons-of-a-YouTube-Channel-and-Podcast-Episode-1" class="headerlink" title="What Are the Pros &amp; Cons of a YouTube Channel and Podcast Episode"></a>What Are the Pros &amp; Cons of a YouTube Channel and Podcast Episode</h2><p><strong>Pros and Cons of a YouTube video:</strong></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>No physical office is required.

To know which is better, podcast or YouTube, you may have to learn about the statistics. Podcasts are seeing a resurgence in popularity, while YouTube is still the top video site in the world. About 383.7 million podcast listeners globally as of November 2022.</p><p>Out of these podcast listeners, 50% are between 12-34 in age, and 43% are between 35-54 in age. In Canada, 1 in 3 people listens to a podcast. The country recorded the highest viewership in the world in 2022. Australian and US podcast listeners are at the top in 2022.</p><p>This number is at 2.1 billion monthly active users for YouTube based all around the world. The global audience of 95% of YouTube viewers is adults between 18 and 29.</p><p>Talking about ads, 80% of podcast listeners believe product ads in a podcast lead to purchase. YouTube also has massive ad growth of 5% ad revenue growth to $7.3 billion in the second quarter of 2022.</p><h2 id="Opportunities-Challenges-for-Podcasts-and-YouTube-1"><a href="#Opportunities-Challenges-for-Podcasts-and-YouTube-1" class="headerlink" title="Opportunities &amp; Challenges for Podcasts and YouTube"></a>Opportunities &amp; Challenges for Podcasts and YouTube</h2><p>There are many opportunities and challenges for creating podcasts and YouTube videos. Podcasts can be a great way to share your knowledge and stories with others while also building an audience.</p><p>However, making an exciting podcast is tricky, and creating a good one takes time and effort. One of the biggest challenges is finding a good topic. In addition, you need to be passionate about what you’re talking about if you want your podcast to be successful.</p><p>Another challenge is finding the right audio or video equipment. If you don’t have the right tools, your podcast will sound poor, and your videos will look amateurish. In addition, many podcasters and YouTubers may struggle to edit videos initially. As a result, people don’t spend much time on their channels.</p><p>There are also many opportunities for making money from podcasts and YouTube videos. For example, you can sell advertising space, sell merchandise, or get sponsorships.

Are you looking to build an audience for your podcast or video channel, generate leads for your business, or simply leave a meaningful legacy behind?</li><li>The second factor you’ll want to consider is <strong>your audience size and engagement</strong>. How many people will actually listen to or watch your content? And how engaged are they with it? Do they regularly share it on social media or respond positively to reviews?</li><li><strong>What format should your content be in?</strong> For example, should it be an audio-only podcast, a video-only channel, or a mixture of both? And what style should it be in – formal or informal?</li><li><strong>You’ll need to ensure that your content is creative and innovative.</strong> Is something unique about your topic that will make it stand out from the crowd? Or do you have new ideas that could be valuable for others to learn about?</li><li><strong>Pick the right niche.</strong> For example, a cooking show may not work well as a podcast, but it could be great as a YouTube series.</li><li><strong>You’ll want to promote your content in the appropriate channels.</strong> If you’re creating a YouTube series based on your podcast, promote it on your podcast platform and your YouTube channel.</li><li><strong>Focus on building skills.</strong> If your current skill level is at a beginner level, you may do well making less complex videos and podcasts. Using tools such as Filmora may help you create and edit videos.</li><li><strong>How you create and promote content may also depend on your budget.</strong> So be mindful of your budget and expand when you receive the proper engagement.</li></ol><h2 id="Final-Words-1"><a href="#Final-Words-1" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>So, which is excellent in the battle of podcast vs. YouTube video? That depends on your personal preferences. If you’d like to create in-depth, topic-focused content, podcasts are probably a better choice.</p><p>If you prefer to create playful and exciting content, then vlogs might be more your thing.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Art-of-Conducting-Engaging-Interviews"><a href="#The-Art-of-Conducting-Engaging-Interviews" class="headerlink" title="The Art of Conducting Engaging Interviews"></a>The Art of Conducting Engaging Interviews</h2><p>Creating a YouTube channel might be advantageous even if you have no intention of becoming a professional YouTuber. It’s a great opportunity to meet others who share your interests and form a community, and you can learn a lot of useful skills, like how to talk more confidently.</p><p>However, it might be difficult to distinguish out when there are so many talented channels in every imaginable field. Making a strong introduction for your films is one of the finest methods to capture the interest of your audience. What therefore ought to your YouTube intros contain? Discover all the crucial details by continuing to read this article.</p><h2 id="1-Keep-your-intro-brief"><a href="#1-Keep-your-intro-brief" class="headerlink" title="1. Keep your intro brief"></a>1. Keep your intro brief</h2><p>The average human attention span has decreased over time. You risk losing viewers if you prolong the beginning of your YouTube video beyond what is essential given the abundance of free materials available today.</p><p>Make sure that your introduction lasts no more than 10 seconds as a general rule of thumb. The shorter the better if you can manage it. Remember, you don’t have to give away everything in your film. You only need to give them enough of a reason to continue watching.</p><h2 id="2-Stay-in-the-theme"><a href="#2-Stay-in-the-theme" class="headerlink" title="2. Stay in the theme"></a>2. Stay in the theme</h2><p>While few rule-breakers have found success, the majority of well-liked YouTube channels have a distinct niche that attracts viewers and followers. Without it, you won’t be able to draw in and satisfy your target market.</p><p>Your opening should be consistent with your theme and branding across the entire YouTube channel. When you know the answers to those questions, you’ll be more equipped to create an interesting YouTube channel introduction.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ukaidot.sjv.io/c/5597632/1793233/19578" target="_top" id="1793233"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19578-1793233"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793233/19578"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Make-the-first-7-seconds-count"><a href="#3-Make-the-first-7-seconds-count" class="headerlink" title="3. Make the first 7 seconds count"></a>3. Make the first 7 seconds count</h2><p>Although branding is important, it won’t guarantee views and subscribers for your YouTube intro. Your efforts will be in vain if you don’t provide your viewers a compelling incentive to stick around.</p><p>Making a great first impression is a must when planning the opening sequence for your YouTube channel. Try to highlight the value the audience will receive from viewing your films; a brief tagline that sums up your core principles is a good starting point.</p><p>Above all else, being genuine will help you make a good first impression. Others will see right through you and move on if you try to force a personality that isn’t yours or if it’s obvious that you’re not interested in the subjects you raise.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://thefitville.pxf.io/c/5597632/1526796/15852" target="_top" id="1526796"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1526796"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="628"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1526796/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Make-a-plan"><a href="#4-Make-a-plan" class="headerlink" title="4. Make a plan"></a>4. Make a plan</h2><p>The quantity of tasks you have to complete before your YouTube channel takes off is one of the most difficult aspects of launching one. If you don’t divide them up into manageable portions, you’ll probably start to feel overwhelmed very quickly.</p><p>One of the best things you can do is plan ahead when making an introduction for your YouTube channel. Making two or three prototypes and putting them through testing to discover which works best could also be helpful.</p><p>It’s important to keep in mind that while you should have a plan, you don’t necessarily need a very detailed one at this time. Have enough to launch you and allow you to make adjustments as you gain velocity.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2086436/19576" target="_top" id="2086436"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2086436"                      border="0" alt="" width="1500" height="400"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2086436/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Include-a-Call-To-Action"><a href="#5-Include-a-Call-To-Action" class="headerlink" title="5. Include a Call-To-Action"></a>5. Include a Call-To-Action</h2><p>Now is the time to deal with any concerns you may have with asking people for things. You won’t get as a content creator if you don’t ask, and this also applies to YouTube.</p><p>After you’ve written your introduction, you might want to think about inserting a call to action (CTA). Users will be prompted to take the action you want them to, such as follow you on social media or subscribe to your channel, if you do this.</p><p>Your CTA needs to be brief and concise. If you make it sound too airy, your audience will miss the point and you’ll come out as uncertain of your goal.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087389/7443" target="_top" id="2087389"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087389"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087389/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-Keep-it-simple"><a href="#6-Keep-it-simple" class="headerlink" title="6. Keep it simple"></a>6. Keep it simple</h2><p>It’s simple to assume that more is better when creating a YouTube channel. However, if you’re just starting out, the opposite is typically true.</p><p>Make a thorough inventory of everything you could include before putting together your YouTube intro. After you’ve written down everything you can think of, pick down the one or two most crucial elements.</p><p>You’ll save a lot of time by making your YouTube intro simpler. Additionally, it will make your channel feel more cohesive.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.manycam.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=17729331&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8230bea7d54bcdf99cdfe85cb07313d5/mcaffbanner600x500.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="7-Create-a-stunning-intro"><a href="#7-Create-a-stunning-intro" class="headerlink" title="7. Create a stunning intro"></a>7. Create a stunning intro</h2><p>For the majority of producers, creating a successful YouTube channel takes years of trial and error. A perfectionist attitude will hold you back in the beginning, especially when it comes to your introduction.</p><p>Make a YouTube opening that’s decent enough to get you started rather than aiming to create something ideal. You can adjust as needed as your talents advance and your understanding of the path you want to go in deepens.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Detailed-Dissection-Straightforward-HDR-Methods"><a href="#Detailed-Dissection-Straightforward-HDR-Methods" class="headerlink" title="Detailed Dissection: Straightforward HDR Methods"></a>Detailed Dissection: Straightforward HDR Methods</h2><p>Any professional photographer knows that “photography” is a broad niche. For example, HDR photography involves taking images in dark and bright areas. But because these images might not show much to the naked eyes, you’ll need an HDR program like <strong>EasyHDR</strong>. This software can recreate and design incredible HDR photos on Mac and Windows computers. So, this review post advises you whether <strong>Easy HDR</strong> is worth the money or not. We’ll also advise on the best way to edit and create HDR videos on PC.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Summary-Box-on-Easy-HDR"><a href="#Part-1-Summary-Box-on-Easy-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Summary Box on Easy HDR"></a>Part 1: Summary Box on Easy HDR</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Description</th><th>EasyHDR is an HDR photography software for highlighting image details in HDR photos. It supports raw images and batch processing.</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Pricing</td><td>$33 for a lifetime license</td></tr><tr><td>Operating System</td><td>Windows 7&#x2F;8&#x2F;10&#x2F;11 and macOS 10.12 or newer</td></tr><tr><td>Layout</td><td>4.5&#x2F;5</td></tr><tr><td>Easy to use</td><td>4.8&#x2F;5</td></tr><tr><td>HDQ quality</td><td>4.2&#x2F;5</td></tr><tr><td>Post-processing</td><td>3.5&#x2F;5</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Before we dive deeper into this <strong>Easy HDRi</strong> review, let’s first discuss how this HDR software rates in some critical aspects:</p><ol><li><strong>Effectiveness – 4.8&#x2F;5</strong></li></ol><p>The HDRi process on this software is very effective, although you shouldn’t have high expectations. It provides manual and automatic lens correction properties, although using the manual option might need a learning curve. Other extras include ghost removal and automatic alignment.</p><ol><li><strong>Price – 4.7&#x2F;5</strong></li></ol><p>Easy HDR is not necessarily a free program. Although there’s a free demo version, it’s pretty limited in features. Therefore, purchase the premium plan for $33 or $55 for personal and lifetime licenses. As a seasoned HDR editor, you should know that other HDR programs like Aurora HDR cost way more than this.</p><ol><li><strong>Supported OS – 5&#x2F;5</strong></li></ol><p>This HDR photography program is compatible with Windows and macOS systems, which is a big plus. You can install it on Windows 7 or newer and macOS 10.12 or newer. Sorry, Linux users!</p><ol><li><strong>Ease of use – 4.8</strong></li></ol><p>Easy HDR is one of the most beginner-friendly HDR processing tools despite the advanced management tools. It features automatic lens correction, ghost removal, and HDR merging capabilities.</p><ol><li><strong>Best for – Beginner HDRi editors</strong></li></ol><p>This program’s simple approach makes it perfect for HDRi photographers without prior editing skills. Also, if you’re a beginner on a tight budget, easyHDR is the best software for you.</p><p><strong>Our Verdict</strong></p><p>Up to this juncture, you might wonder if Easy HDR is worth the money or not. Well, that depends on what you want. If you have minimal HDR editing knowledge, then this is the best professional program for you.</p><p>The straightforward layout boasts automatic HDR editing tools to make your work effortless. In addition, it supports a wide array of image formats, including photos taken using your DSLR camera. And the $33&#x2F;lifetime price should be manageable by many average Joes.</p><p>But on the flip side, Easy HDR lacks in-depth post-processing tools. Also, it lacks the all-important “undo” feature, which is vital in HDR image editing. Other than that, it’s the perfect program to make dramatic and realistic HDR photos.</p><p>Pros</p><ul><li>Simple layout.</li><li>Make realistic HDR images with automatic tools.</li><li>Easy HDRi Blender and Adobe Lightroom plugins.</li><li>Standalone Easy HDR desktop program.</li><li>Batch processing supported.</li><li>Compatible with multiple image formats, including RAW.</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul><li>It doesn’t have advanced HDR post-processing tools.</li><li>No HDR feature for editing.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Detailed-Review-for-Easy-HDR"><a href="#Part-2-Detailed-Review-for-Easy-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Detailed Review for Easy HDR"></a>Part 2. Detailed Review for Easy HDR</h2><p>Before diving deeper into the detailed Easy HDR features, it’s important to note that the program has a demo version. You can use this version to practice and study the vital components of easyHDR. But be guided that the demo version exports images with a watermark. In addition, users can’t save HDRi in TIFF format. Let’s get in!</p><ol><li><strong>High-Quality Bracket Merging</strong></li></ol><p>A good quality HDRi software should easily merge different image exposures, making the photo look natural and spectacular. To start incorporating, drag the image brackets to easyHDR and press “Ok” on the pop-up screen. You can now try the different bracket merging effects until you find something that suits your preference.</p><ol><li><strong>Editing features</strong></li></ol><p>EasyHDR goes a step further to provide its users with a comprehensive list of editing features. For example, the “Clone Stamp” tool can remove unwanted objects like cables without blurring the photo. You can also use the “Tone Curve” feature to adjust the brightness of shadows and highlights.</p><ol><li><strong>Ghost removal</strong></li></ol><p>No, this is not the scary ghost that you know. Instead, these ghosting artefacts appear in misaligned photos due to moving objects like leaves, branches, cars, people, etc. With Easy HDR, you can eliminate the “ghosts” manually or automatically. Simply open the photo and turn on “Ghost Removal” to remove them automatically.</p><ol><li><strong>HDR batch processing</strong></li></ol><p>As expected, you can find it pretty tedious to import and merge each HDR bracket individually. For this reason, easyHDR comes with a “Batch Processing” feature that allows users to combine a whole folder of brackets automatically.</p><ol><li><strong>LDR enhancement</strong></li></ol><p>Although we’ve mainly focused on brackets and photos in this post, it’s important to note that easyHDR also works with single images. Instead of having three separate bracketed exposures, LDR (Low Dynamic Range) enhancement allows you to generate exposures from a single JPEG or RAW photo.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://tinyland.pxf.io/c/5597632/1793214/19135" target="_top" id="1793214"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793214"                      border="0" alt="" width="900" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793214/19135"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Bonus-Tips-The-Best-Way-to-Edit-HDR-videos-on-your-Desktop"><a href="#Bonus-Tips-The-Best-Way-to-Edit-HDR-videos-on-your-Desktop" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tips: The Best Way to Edit HDR videos on your Desktop"></a>Bonus Tips: The Best Way to Edit HDR videos on your Desktop</h2><p>Like HDR images, HDR videos offer more comprehensive displays in dark and bright surroundings. In short, these videos allow more colourful and detailed highlight representations. Unfortunately, not all HDR editing programs can merge bracketed exposures effortlessly to produce outstanding results. And those that do can cost you an arm and a leg.</p><p>With that in mind, we recommend <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for professional and semi-professional HDR editors.

And don’t forget to use Wondershare Filmora 11 to apply a cool HDR effect to your footage. Give it a try!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>Before we dive deeper into this <strong>Easy HDRi</strong> review, let’s first discuss how this HDR software rates in some critical aspects:</p><ol><li><strong>Effectiveness – 4.8&#x2F;5</strong></li></ol><p>The HDRi process on this software is very effective, although you shouldn’t have high expectations. It provides manual and automatic lens correction properties, although using the manual option might need a learning curve. Other extras include ghost removal and automatic alignment.</p><ol><li><strong>Price – 4.7&#x2F;5</strong></li></ol><p>Easy HDR is not necessarily a free program. Although there’s a free demo version, it’s pretty limited in features. Therefore, purchase the premium plan for $33 or $55 for personal and lifetime licenses. As a seasoned HDR editor, you should know that other HDR programs like Aurora HDR cost way more than this.</p><ol><li><strong>Supported OS – 5&#x2F;5</strong></li></ol><p>This HDR photography program is compatible with Windows and macOS systems, which is a big plus. You can install it on Windows 7 or newer and macOS 10.12 or newer. Sorry, Linux users!</p><ol><li><strong>Ease of use – 4.8</strong></li></ol><p>Easy HDR is one of the most beginner-friendly HDR processing tools despite the advanced management tools. It features automatic lens correction, ghost removal, and HDR merging capabilities.</p><ol><li><strong>Best for – Beginner HDRi editors</strong></li></ol><p>This program’s simple approach makes it perfect for HDRi photographers without prior editing skills. Also, if you’re a beginner on a tight budget, easyHDR is the best software for you.</p><p><strong>Our Verdict</strong></p><p>Up to this juncture, you might wonder if Easy HDR is worth the money or not. Well, that depends on what you want. If you have minimal HDR editing knowledge, then this is the best professional program for you.</p><p>The straightforward layout boasts automatic HDR editing tools to make your work effortless. In addition, it supports a wide array of image formats, including photos taken using your DSLR camera. And the $33&#x2F;lifetime price should be manageable by many average Joes.</p><p>But on the flip side, Easy HDR lacks in-depth post-processing tools. Also, it lacks the all-important “undo” feature, which is vital in HDR image editing. Other than that, it’s the perfect program to make dramatic and realistic HDR photos.</p><p>Pros</p><ul><li>Simple layout.</li><li>Make realistic HDR images with automatic tools.</li><li>Easy HDRi Blender and Adobe Lightroom plugins.</li><li>Standalone Easy HDR desktop program.</li><li>Batch processing supported.</li><li>Compatible with multiple image formats, including RAW.</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul><li>It doesn’t have advanced HDR post-processing tools.</li><li>No HDR feature for editing.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398457/3022" target="_top" id="398457"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398457"                      border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="980" height="120"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398457/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Detailed-Review-for-Easy-HDR-1"><a href="#Part-2-Detailed-Review-for-Easy-HDR-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Detailed Review for Easy HDR"></a>Part 2. Detailed Review for Easy HDR</h2><p>Before diving deeper into the detailed Easy HDR features, it’s important to note that the program has a demo version. You can use this version to practice and study the vital components of easyHDR. But be guided that the demo version exports images with a watermark. In addition, users can’t save HDRi in TIFF format. Let’s get in!</p><ol><li><strong>High-Quality Bracket Merging</strong></li></ol><p>A good quality HDRi software should easily merge different image exposures, making the photo look natural and spectacular. To start incorporating, drag the image brackets to easyHDR and press “Ok” on the pop-up screen. You can now try the different bracket merging effects until you find something that suits your preference.</p><ol><li><strong>Editing features</strong></li></ol><p>EasyHDR goes a step further to provide its users with a comprehensive list of editing features. For example, the “Clone Stamp” tool can remove unwanted objects like cables without blurring the photo. You can also use the “Tone Curve” feature to adjust the brightness of shadows and highlights.</p><ol><li><strong>Ghost removal</strong></li></ol><p>No, this is not the scary ghost that you know. Instead, these ghosting artefacts appear in misaligned photos due to moving objects like leaves, branches, cars, people, etc. With Easy HDR, you can eliminate the “ghosts” manually or automatically. Simply open the photo and turn on “Ghost Removal” to remove them automatically.</p><ol><li><strong>HDR batch processing</strong></li></ol><p>As expected, you can find it pretty tedious to import and merge each HDR bracket individually. For this reason, easyHDR comes with a “Batch Processing” feature that allows users to combine a whole folder of brackets automatically.</p><ol><li><strong>LDR enhancement</strong></li></ol><p>Although we’ve mainly focused on brackets and photos in this post, it’s important to note that easyHDR also works with single images. Instead of having three separate bracketed exposures, LDR (Low Dynamic Range) enhancement allows you to generate exposures from a single JPEG or RAW photo.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tips-The-Best-Way-to-Edit-HDR-videos-on-your-Desktop-1"><a href="#Bonus-Tips-The-Best-Way-to-Edit-HDR-videos-on-your-Desktop-1" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tips: The Best Way to Edit HDR videos on your Desktop"></a>Bonus Tips: The Best Way to Edit HDR videos on your Desktop</h2><p>Like HDR images, HDR videos offer more comprehensive displays in dark and bright surroundings. In short, these videos allow more colourful and detailed highlight representations. Unfortunately, not all HDR editing programs can merge bracketed exposures effortlessly to produce outstanding results. And those that do can cost you an arm and a leg.</p><p>With that in mind, we recommend <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for professional and semi-professional HDR editors.

What Is Video Resolution"></a>Part 1. What Is Video Resolution</h2><p>If we speak in basic words, video resolution means the number of pixels displayed in each distinct dimension. The resolution of any video is usually written as a combination of height and width. If you want to know how clear the video is or how realistic it looks, then video resolution is that one element that will answer all your questions. Sounds intriguing, right?</p><p>With video resolution, you can see video images in any video recording. When you hear someone say the high-resolution video, the viewer can see a sharp and clear video. A higher number of pixels results in high quality and better resolution video. Ultra HD and Full HD are the two widely used video resolutions. Don’t know much about them? Nothing to worry!</p><p>Whereas, whenever you come across the word low-resolution video or poor resolution video, it means that there is a low number of pixels. Now moving on, let us talk a little about the two significant types of video resolution. One is the default type, that’s the ‘Spatial Resolution.’ It is measured in pixels with the height and the width. In contrast, the other type is the ‘Temporal Resolution,’ which is the frames rate.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-video-resolution-for-beginners-1.jpg"                      alt="video resolution in-general"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Types-of-Video-Resolution-List"><a href="#Part-2-Types-of-Video-Resolution-List" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

What Is Video Resolution"></a>Part 1. What Is Video Resolution</h2><p>If we speak in basic words, video resolution means the number of pixels displayed in each distinct dimension. The resolution of any video is usually written as a combination of height and width. If you want to know how clear the video is or how realistic it looks, then video resolution is that one element that will answer all your questions. Sounds intriguing, right?</p><p>With video resolution, you can see video images in any video recording. When you hear someone say the high-resolution video, the viewer can see a sharp and clear video. A higher number of pixels results in high quality and better resolution video. Ultra HD and Full HD are the two widely used video resolutions. Don’t know much about them? Nothing to worry!</p><p>Whereas, whenever you come across the word low-resolution video or poor resolution video, it means that there is a low number of pixels. Now moving on, let us talk a little about the two significant types of video resolution. One is the default type, that’s the ‘Spatial Resolution.’ It is measured in pixels with the height and the width. In contrast, the other type is the ‘Temporal Resolution,’ which is the frames rate.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-video-resolution-for-beginners-1.jpg"                      alt="video resolution in-general"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DSysTools%2BOST%2BRecovery"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/ost-recovery.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Types-of-Video-Resolution-List-2"><a href="#Part-2-Types-of-Video-Resolution-List-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

There are various resolutions. The naming convention of these resolutions is based on how the pixels are running. It could either be a vertical line moving down the display area, or the movement could be across the frame in a horizontal line.</p><p>Want to know more about them? Without further delay, let us start sharing the video resolution list one by one.

As mentioned earlier, pixels are a combination of height and width, so 360p is 640 x 360 resolution, whereas 640 x 480 is 480p resolution. Since the advancement of television and monitors, no one films in SD resolutions anymore. The world is changing, for sure!</p><p>360p resolution is still the most suitable option for smartphones and other mobile devices. This is because it uses less data.

This resolution is often known as Full HD resolution. 1080p resolution is now the standard for the industry to film HD digital videos. Full HD videos mostly have a resolution of 1920 x 1080.</p><p>With the advancement and change in time, many smartphones now have a screen resolution of 1080p.

With every next resolution we are discussing, the video quality is getting better and better. With these resolutions, reframing is done without any quality loss.</p><p>Another thing that you should know about 2K videos is because it has a resolution of 2048 x 1080.

Although 2K and 4K are somewhat, similar experts say that with 4K, you have better editing options, and you can also zoom in.</p><p>4K resolution is used where you need intense color and graphics. 4K videos have a resolution of 3840 x 2160.

This is the best option for zooming in to take a distant shot. 8k is the video super-resolution.</p><p>Although filmmakers don’t usually film with this video resolution, if they do, then one thing that they achieve is enhanced visual effects. Also, with using 8K video resolution, you can easily reframe without the fear of losing quality. It has a video resolution of 7680 x 4320.

You cannot just pick any video resolution to film your video. To help you all, let us talk about choosing the right video resolution. The first step for this process demands you to consider the following mentioned questions.</p><ul><li>How much detail do you want to show? The more detail, the higher the resolution is needed.</li><li>You must know clearly about the objective of using this video.</li><li>How do you plan to share this video with your friends?</li><li>What is the preference of your audience when it comes to video quality?</li></ul><p>Now, moving on, since you have considered these questions, let’s just quickly jump on to the next part of this section. We will be guiding you about different resolutions.</p><ul><li>Starting with a 480p resolution size. If you are making a demo video, this is the most suitable resolution. 480p is the smallest video resolution. With this, you can create small but clear videos.</li><li>The next resolution in line is 720p. For your social media videos, this video resolution is perfect. Although 720p is not the highest resolution, it still has class and quality.</li><li>Moving on to 1080p, this is the largest and the best video resolution for video streaming sites like YouTube and Vimeo. The video quality is great with this resolution.</li><li>Lastly, let us add and talk about 2k and 4k video resolution. 2k is bigger and better than 1080p, and if we look at 4k, it’s even bigger than 2k. It offers phenomenal video quality.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DSysTools%2BGmail%2BBackup"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/gmail-backup.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Ending-Thoughts-2"><a href="#Ending-Thoughts-2" class="headerlink" title="Ending Thoughts"></a>Ending Thoughts</h3><p>After sharing a lot of information about video resolutions, this article concludes.

An enormous foundation that retorts to steps. The join allows to duck, though, how relaxed will it feel to be sit in such a “chair,” particularly when playing some games like GTA? It is compatible with Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. For those users who are absolute to pre-order, these products should know that the problem of space is not a problem anymore. But the foundation of the treadmill machine looks too dense, particularly in judgment with Cyberith.</p><p>It is rated at $699 for pre-order on the certified website of the product. While engaging an order, one must specify the size of the shoe that arises with the set. And also, there are accessible numerous accessories and plug-in apparatuses for the treadmill machines from $60 to $80.</p><p> <strong><em>You may also like:</em></strong><br><em><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 8 Best VR Controllers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em><br><em><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 10 Mobile VR headsets <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em><br><em><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top Virtual Reality (VR) Bikes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=174416&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.easygifanimator.net/images/gif-animator.png"                      border="0"                >Easy GIF Animator is a powerful animated GIF editor and the top tool for creating animated pictures, banners, buttons and GIF videos.

The podium here is lesser bulky, and the steps are pursued by the motion sensors. Bowing actions can be achieved more usual due to the opportunity in order to lean on one lap, lacking risk to hurt it. The assembly itself is more moveable, which is the reason it is more attractive, particularly in view of its dimensions. It is also compatible with Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. The lighter structure, and, the very idea of the treadmill guises more auspicious. It is minor, its working technique is based on gliding, not on the crusade of the platform. if the idea of the surface will turn out to be as easy as simple walking, Virtualizer will be the leading product. Furthermore, the device does not need any special shoes, excluding one purchase. There is no official price yet, because of the non-existence of bulk shipment.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.textstudio.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35633309&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/d6eb8222c9718486bdabce8b897380f7/products/3_premium-icon.png"                      border="0"                > Take advantage of PREMIUM features for 12 months.<br>Create your texts &#x2F; logos without any limitation.<br>No attribution required when downloading.<br>No advertising on the website.<br> TextStudio.com  PREMIUM - Yearly Membership</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-KatWalk"><a href="#3-KatWalk" class="headerlink" title="3.

A superior fascination is located in the higher part of the structure and will defend the user from dwindling. The procedure of walking does not have a gliding effect, the interaction with the surface is automatic, as present in the Omni. For sure the user will need extra shoes that are given in the form of somewhat weighty shoes. Certainly a questionable prototypical, but it got the utmost considerable funding outside Kickstarter amongst all the others products. The price is unknown yet because of no bulk production.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BBusiness%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/business-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Spacewalker-VR"><a href="#4-Spacewalker-VR" class="headerlink" title="4.

The hardware structures a spinning treadmill, derived by a gyroscope that wits the user’s actions. Weight sensors beneath the platform notice differences in foot pressure to regulate its power feedback. Apart from its application in the VR, this can also be used as a normal treadmill for aptness training. The SpaceWalkerVR is presently in the prototyping phase and is probable to back the Oculus Rift. Its extra Fantastic Engine provision is predictable to open up SpaceWalkerVR’s apps in virtual gaming surroundings.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3546200&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.binteko.com/sites/default/files/banner01_468x60a.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Infinadeck"><a href="#5-Infinadeck" class="headerlink" title="5.

Dissimilar to the Virtuix Omni, which is basically a still platform, the Infinadeck actually works by powering a square set of corresponding “mini-treadmills” to exactly put on walking and running actions ranged with any virtual reality concept. It bids the sensation of usual action of jogging, running, or walking in the real life by powering the set of treadmills in any of the direction.</p><h2 id="Why-we-need-VR-treadmills-and-What-is-it"><a href="#Why-we-need-VR-treadmills-and-What-is-it" class="headerlink" title="Why we need VR treadmills and What is it?"></a>Why we need VR treadmills and What is it?</h2><p>You have tried the experience of VR headset and happiness, enjoyment, and bright emotions are what you are certainly going to feel just after 10 minutes of sitting in that chair and relishing some preview provided by the developers. Now, stop your eruption of ecstasy attended by tears of pleasure and then think about a more thoughtful game. An object which is useful in the daily life and for the health purposes as well. Just imagine you are running on the great wall of china, or in the streets of the Antarctica. Isn’t it a great feeling to enjoy such walk. Virtual reality treadmills provide such experiences right in your home. There are two benefits provided by the VR treadmills when you run on this treadmill you feel like running at the most beautiful locations in the world and your health gets better.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657399/16446" target="_top" id="1657399"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657399"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657399/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-Do-VR-treadmills-Work"><a href="#How-Do-VR-treadmills-Work" class="headerlink" title="How Do VR treadmills Work?"></a>How Do VR treadmills Work?</h2><p>As a gamer, you would know that safe, and special shoes will offer the most relaxed experience from running around in VR worlds. In addition to this crouch provision (in Virtuix Omni) and get a satisfactorily gorgeous option for shooters and all kinds of “walk emulators.” In this racing, and other categories that do not include much walking, the maneuver becomes less valuable: a mixture of “wheel + helmet” is still a more suitable option. Though many will ponder even these benefits a luxury, and some of them just cannot or will not want to kill opponents with a plastic rummage that comes within the set. The camera alignment is immovable for the treadmill and the helmet as well, but there is only one snag. In such games where the user can turn his head discretely from the body the feature will work accordingly, but in the mainstream of up-to-date shooters, it will turn out to be one more “backstab”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

Keeping it simpler, a time-lapse video is made with keeping camera undisturbed whereas hyper-lapse videos involverecording the video while moving the camera.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620780&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/728__90banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Final-Verdict"><a href="#Final-Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a>Final Verdict</h2><p>Now you have mastered everything about time-lapse videos and time lapse apps on Android.

The latest edition to the Windows family was rolled out on July 29th, and those who have been able to make the upgrade have had some pretty nice things to say about it. Time will ultimately tell if Windows 10 is really going to be a hit, but early indications point to that being the case.</p><p>If you’re still waiting for the go-ahead from Microsoft to download Windows 10 free, then you at least have some time to look at some of the Windows 10 features.</p><h4 id="1-Top-Windows-10-Features"><a href="#1-Top-Windows-10-Features" class="headerlink" title="1. Top Windows 10 Features"></a>1. Top Windows 10 Features</h4><p>With Windows 10, it would seem as though Microsoft actually listened to people. The improvements to Windows 10 are vast, when you compare them to Windows 8 or Windows 8.1. We all know by now just how unpopular Windows 8 and 8.1 were. Some people even decided to stick with Windows 7 instead.</p><p>Microsoft is clearly looking to bring the world at large on board with Windows 10. To that end, they have brought a number of exciting features to the table:</p><p><strong>Cortana Virtual Assistant</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/windows10/update-win10-13.png"                      alt="update win10 13"                ></p><p>Cortana is one of the biggest features Microsoft is rolling out for the Windows 10. If you have been using the Windows Phone, then you already have an idea of what to expect from the tablet&#x2F;PC version. This digital assistant is designed to be vastly superior to Siri or Google Now. You’ll find Cortana next to your desktop’s start button, but you can also say “Hey, Cortana” to bring it to life. You remain in complete control of how much Cortana knows about you, but you’ll definitely love the way Cortana can bring up requested information instantly. Early users have also noted that Cortana is more than capable of maintaining a full, almost-natural conversational flow.</p><p><strong>Edge Web Browser</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edge.jpg"                      alt="edge"                ></p><p>Say goodbye to Internet Explorer. The long-disliked browser is finally being chucked aside, in favor of something that will strive to be decidedly different. Although IE will still support legacy software, Edge is clearly the one taking center stage as the default browser for Windows 10. Features will include a screen grabbing tool that offers touchscreen sketching capabilities, a reading mode, and even a notepad. Search results will be built around your preferences, and you will have the ability as well to get restaurant information or directions shot to you in an instant.</p><p><strong>Windows 10 Start Menu</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/windows10/a8.png"                      alt="a8"                ></p><p>No one really liked the start menu layout for Windows 8 and Windows 8.1. Windows 10 offers a fantastic improvement to that end. If the start menu looks quite familiar, that’s because Microsoft has made it a point to bring back the style virtually all of us prefer. Yet Windows 10 will have some decided differences. The start menu will allow you to look over frequently-used apps, use the universal search without swiping, and yes, the tiles will be there, as well. However, you will be able to control how prominent they are.</p><p>These are just three of the new features of Windows 10. Ready to learn about a few more?</p><h4 id="2-More-Windows-10-Features"><a href="#2-More-Windows-10-Features" class="headerlink" title="2. More Windows 10 Features"></a>2. More Windows 10 Features</h4><p>The above three features are good examples of what Windows 10 will bring to the table, but that’s not it by a long shot:</p><p><strong>Xbox App and Streaming</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/windows10/xboy-games-windows10-1.png"                      alt="xbox games windows10"                ></p><p>Windows 10 will include an exciting Xbox app, which will come loaded with possibilities. The Xbox app will give you the ability to control your Xbox One, but you’ll also be able to utilize your DVR capture for your Windows games. Even more exciting is the way you’ll have the ability to play multiplayer titles across between your Xbox One and your PC. With the streaming side of things, Windows 10 will allow you to stream titles from your Xbox Box. There will also be DirectX 12 support.</p><p> <strong>Universal Apps</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/universal_apps.jpg"                      alt="universal_apps"                ></p><p>If you’re going to use Windows 10 across several different devices, you’re going to love this aspect. Photos, Music, Video, Map, People, and other apps will be available across all your devices. Furthermore, Windows 10 will ensure that your apps will look and function the same, regardless of the app you’re using.</p><p> <strong>Design and Interface Improvements</strong></p><p>There is a cohesiveness and consistency to everything that is going to make Windows 10 a highly pleasant experience for most of the people who use it. You’ll find that in terms of design and user interface, Windows 10 is a combination of modern features, the few good things about Windows 8 and Windows 8.1., and elements from past editions that we never wanted to get rid of.</p><h4 id="3-Get-Ready-For-Windows-10"><a href="#3-Get-Ready-For-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="3.Get Ready For Windows 10"></a>3.Get Ready For Windows 10</h4><p>Some people are already enjoying Windows 10. Microsoft is slowly-but-surely making sure that everyone gets Windows 10 in good time. If you have Windows 8.1, Windows Phone 8.1, or even Windows 7, then you’re entitled to a free upgrade to the brave new world of Windows 10.</p><p><img                       lazyload

Compared with other 360-degree cameras, it’s shape is very unique and crashproof. Below are the complete specs, pros and cons, reviews and suggestions about Giroptic 360cam, hope these can give you a reference if you want to buy a 360-degree camera.</p><p><strong>Related article:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 5 360 Degree Action Cameras &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1:Complete Review</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2:Pros and Cons at a glance</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3:Basic specs</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4:Should I buy</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Complete-Review-of-Giroptic-360cam"><a href="#Part-1-Complete-Review-of-Giroptic-360cam" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Complete Review of Giroptic 360cam"></a>Part 1: Complete Review of Giroptic 360cam</h2><p> <strong>Brief introduction</strong></p><p> Giroptic 360cam is the first consumer-ready camera that was born out of a Kickstarter campaign two years ago that brought in $ 1.4 million of crowdfunding. With access to this affordable full HD camera one no longer needs expensive camera rigs and post-processing software to create 360 degree images or videos with Virtual Reality (VR) experience. Armed with three equidistant optical lenses and three microphones, it records full spherical videos and high quality JPEG images that can be shared via your smartphone or computers without any extra software.</p><p> <strong>Design</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/giroptic-360cam-details.png"                      alt="Giroptic Design"                ></p><p> The funky pear or egg shaped design of Giroptic 360cam not only makes it totally compact and compatible to all kinds of environments and uses but also quite unique in the market. While the top houses the lenses, the bottom third of the body is detachable and holds that battery and the micro-SD card. The tripod mount and the Ethernet port are also located at the bottom of the camera. The black rubber coating makes it extremely suitable for rugged use and also water-resistant; it can survive up to 30 feet deep underwater for 30 minutes.</p><p> <strong>How to use it</strong></p><p> Operating Giroptic is very easy as it is essentially one-button process. You only need to press once to record, once to stop; leave the stitching and processing of the frames to your camera. The stitched videos&#x2F;images will be automatically ready to be uploaded to social sites.</p><p> Apart from the button to start&#x2F;stop recording, there’s another small button in the camera that lets you switch between different shooting modes like Video, Photo, Burst and Timelapse.</p><p> It uses a small LED display to show you the current shooting mode and the power level of the camera.</p><p> An inbuilt adaptor allows you to look at photos as soon as you take them and decide whether to delete the unwanted photos.</p><p> <strong>Where to use Giroptic 360cam</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/giroptic-360cam-where-to-use.JPG"                      alt="Giroptic- Where to use"                ></p><p> Giroptic 360cam is capable of functioning as a good surveillance camera in your home or workspace. This smart camera can be the diligent record-keeper of all your important business meetings, travels, memorable gathering of family and friends or any sports event.</p><p> <strong>Video and Image Quality</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/giroptic-360-cam-image-quality.jpg"                      alt="Giroptic- image quality"                ></p><p> The camera can capture 4K photos at up to three shots per second and record 2K videos at 30 frames per second. However, its maker Ollier admits that Giroptic 360cam can’t compete with high-end professional 360 cams of Nikon or GoPro. The 2K videos created by the camera have slightly visible stitching lines. However, the sophisticated digital stabilization technology used in the camera ensures that the processed footages run smooth and look good. For amateur shooting purposes, it is no doubt the best!</p><p> <strong>How to edit</strong></p><p> You don’t need any extra software or external accessory to process the captured images and videos and stitch them into single 360-degree spherical shot. Your Giroptic cam will do that automatically and make the stitched video file ready for social media sites like YouTube, Facebook and Instagram right in the camera itself. It is a smart gadget that knows which sites accept what file formats.</p><p> With the help of the Giroptic’s mobile app lets you can easily adjust a few settings, activate camera stabilization during a live feed.</p><p> The stitched photos and videos can be easily transferred to any device including smartphones, tablets, PCs and virtual reality headsets.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Pros-and-Cons-of-Giroptic-360cam-at-a-glance"><a href="#Part-2-Pros-and-Cons-of-Giroptic-360cam-at-a-glance" class="headerlink" title="Part 2:Pros and Cons of Giroptic 360cam at a glance"></a>Part 2:Pros and Cons of Giroptic 360cam at a glance</h2><p> Giroptic 360cam provides you with a number of definite advantages over its competitors in the market.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Replaceable battery&#x2F;SD card</td><td>Video isn’t as detailed as that from other 360-degree cameras</td></tr><tr><td>Water-resistant</td><td>Has trouble stitching video</td></tr><tr><td>Light bulb and Ethernet accessories</td><td>Quite expensive</td></tr><tr><td>Takes true 360-degree images</td><td>Low video quality</td></tr><tr><td>Has an impressive storage space.</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Live stream feature</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Rubberized skin.</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Has a universal mount and micro USB port.</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Its egg shaped design makes it compact and portable.</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Shock and water resistant.</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>360cam has native apps both for Android and iOS mobile devices.</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Stitching done in-camera</td><td>-</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BEducational%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/educational-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Basic-specs-of-Giroptic-360cam"><a href="#Part-3-Basic-specs-of-Giroptic-360cam" class="headerlink" title="Part 3:Basic specs of Giroptic 360cam"></a>Part 3:Basic specs of Giroptic 360cam</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Full name</th><th>Giroptic 360cam</th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Price</td><td>Official: $499</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Basic specifications</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Date Available</td><td>2016-05-24</td><td>Manufacturer</td><td>Giroptic</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>180g</td><td>Size</td><td>70x70x71 mm</td></tr><tr><td>Memory</td><td>internal standard SD card slot support is up to 128GB</td><td>Accessible</td><td>WIFI&#x2F;In-built GPS</td></tr><tr><td>Battery</td><td>Rechargeable Li-ion Battery 1180mAH, 3.7V up to 1 hour in video mode</td><td>Body material</td><td>Magnesium alloy and rubber</td></tr><tr><td>Sensor</td><td>custom-made CMOS sensors</td><td>Lenses</td><td>Three 185 degree fisheye lenses</td></tr><tr><td>Image resolution</td><td>Max 4096 x 2048</td><td>Video resolution</td><td>Max 2048 x 1024</td></tr><tr><td>Aspect Ratio</td><td>16:9</td><td>Tripod Mount</td><td>regular mount thread</td></tr><tr><td>Image format</td><td>JPEG</td><td>Video file format</td><td>Video file format</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://caperobbin.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006118/18460" target="_top" id="2006118"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18460-2006118"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2006118/18460"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Should-I-buy"><a href="#Part-4-Should-I-buy" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Should I buy"></a>Part 4: Should I buy</h2><p> Though the video quality is not as good as Kodak’s or 360fly’s, Giroptic 360cam is certainly a good HD cam which records true 360-degree images. It is also more compatible and works with more smartphone models than cameras like Samsung Gear 360. With its shock and water resistant features and the tough rubber coating on the body, it is certainly more durable than many other cameras in the market. Although Giroptic is costlier than LG’s 360-degree camera, the video captured by the former is much better in quality.

The holodeck was what true Virtual Reality should be, full body tactile immersion both narrative immersion, which occurs “when the viewer becomes emotionally invested in the story” and the feeling of “really being there”, called spatial immersion.</p><p> <strong><em>You may also like:</em></strong><br><em><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Differences between VR, AR and MR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em><br><em><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Virtual Reality Technology: Current State and Future Challenges <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em></p><h2 id="The-equipment-used-for-VR-is-very-expensive"><a href="#The-equipment-used-for-VR-is-very-expensive" class="headerlink" title="The equipment used for VR is very expensive"></a>The equipment used for VR is very expensive</h2><p> Of course with any early stage technology, there are a host of issues to overcome among the first is cost for consumers to participate. Many systems run between $100 and $600 and we have not yet discussed the cost of purchasing experiences or games.</p><h2 id="Low-resoultion-content-large-file-size"><a href="#Low-resoultion-content-large-file-size" class="headerlink" title="Low resoultion content, large file size"></a>Low resoultion content, large file size</h2><p> The new goggles or headsets that are coming out offer best available high resolution displays. But gaming experience is coming on at low resolution, leaving you with a low resolution experience. Below is a greatly condensed technical discussion explaining why VR is still so profoundly mediocre.</p><ul><li><strong>File size</strong></li></ul><p> Current VR platforms require a some kind of download to begin. Often the file sizes are over 1 GB and requisitely, slow.</p><ul><li><strong>Video quality</strong></li></ul><p> The next issue is simply video quality. Most VR is in stereo format and the hardware is just not able to fully support it. The video comes through grainy and muffled like it was shot that way and of course it was not. Improved resolution is the fix. There is another obvious thought here. Why claim to have a market worthy product when one of the fundamental technologies, viewing, is still unstable?</p><ul><li><strong>Resolution</strong></li></ul><p> What is the issue with fixing resolution. A couple of questions must be addressed to solve the problems. What is the display resolution? This is the screen resolution. The second question is, “Does all of the images that can come through, actually come through or is it cut off in some way?” This is field-of-view resolution. These questions have technical answers and industry engineers are working to provide a seamless solution, but we are brought back to the conclusion that VR technology while close to delivering true Phase I, which is reasonably easy to use technology is not quite there. Industry insiders use language like it is still in its experimental stage, of course that will not stop the industry from selling these units to early adopters.</p><ul><li><strong>Social Consequences</strong></li></ul><p> There is an addictive quality of Virtual Reality environments that should not be ignored. Those who are regular users of these spaces, even in its developmental state find that it can be hard to stay away. Users find themselves in some cases, preferring the virtual world to the real one. If these anecdotal experiences are being reported by a very small sample size what will be the impact on entire cultures that embrace this technology? Considerations of Virtual Reality must extend into the world of human activity and definitions of normal behavior. And as a reminder most of us who love science fiction have a sense of what true Virtual Reality really is. It should be clear that we are a very long way from enjoying the holodeck.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluetties.sjv.io/c/5597632/2039292/17094" target="_top" id="2039292"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17094-2039292"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC240" width="954" height="1020"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2039292/17094"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Video-Editor-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Best-Video-Editor-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Editor: Wondershare Filmora"></a>Best Video Editor: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993650">                    <video width="720" height="300" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993650.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993650">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993650.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:720px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993650%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993650/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg)<!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4572700&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.tubedigger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tubedigger-software-new.png"                      border="0"                >TubeDigger -

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Persuasive-Films-That-Hook-and-Hold-Audiences"><a href="#Persuasive-Films-That-Hook-and-Hold-Audiences" class="headerlink" title="Persuasive Films That Hook and Hold Audiences"></a>Persuasive Films That Hook and Hold Audiences</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/popular-types-of-videos.jpg"                      alt="popular types of videos"                ></p><p>When it comes to social media, one of the most important things you can do is create engaging content that will capture your audience’s attention because the more engaged your audience is, the more likely they are to buy from you or use your services. And one of the best ways to do that is through video.</p><p>There are many different types of videos you can create, but not all of them will be equally effective at hooking your viewers. To help you get started, here are six types of videos that are sure to capture your audience’s attention on social media:</p><h2 id="1-Behind-the-scenes-videos"><a href="#1-Behind-the-scenes-videos" class="headerlink" title="1. Behind-the-scenes videos"></a>1. Behind-the-scenes videos</h2><p>Your viewers will love getting a peek behind the scenes of your business or organization. Behind-the-scenes videos can give them a look at what goes into making your product or service, and they’ll be able to see the people who make it all happen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/behine-the-scenes-video.jpg"                      alt="behind the scenes video"                ></p><p><strong>Key elements of an effective behind-the-scenes video:</strong></p><ul><li>Make it about the team working together. A behind-the-scenes video is not just about the people working in front of the camera; it’s also about how everyone works as a team. Showcase different departments, use satellite shots to show where you work and include interviews with other members throughout the process. This can help build customer loyalty and improve brand awareness.</li><li>Don’t be afraid to show some personality! Behind-the-scene videos can be funny, but they should never be tacky or inappropriate — even if it means turning down an opportunity for a quick joke or two.

To maintain your attention on the primary speaker without straining your eyes, all you have to do is pin them to the top row of your grid.</li><li>Google Meet has you covered whether you want to record a meeting for posterity, share a copy of it with coworkers who couldn’t make it, or refer to it afterwards. All you have to do to start recording meetings is choose that option from the three-dot menu at the bottom of the screen.</li><li>Numerous individuals are often present during Google Meet calls. You should turn on the grid or tile layout if you want to be sure to see them all, or at least as many as you can. Simply choose the Tiled option from the three-dot menu at the bottom of the screen. You may then use the slider in the pop-out window to show 6 to 49 more participants.</li><li>If you are the call’s owner, you may turn off everyone else’s microphone by placing your mouse over the volume symbol and selecting Silence.</li><li>For added convenience, Google Meet lets you cast a meeting to another screen. The TV in your living room or conference room may be projected from your laptop or desktop, in other words.</li><li>Similar to the subtitle feature seen on other applications like Skype, this feature allows you to have the dialogue show in text on your screen in real-time so that you can more easily understand what is being said during video chats. It is exclusively offered in English. Click Turn on Captions in the Meet’s bottom right corner to turn it on.</li><li>Users of Google Meet will be able to pin many individuals to the top of their tiled screen. This will be especially useful if you have meetings where two or three people talk the majority of the time.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.textstudio.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35633309&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/d6eb8222c9718486bdabce8b897380f7/products/3_premium-icon.png"                      border="0"                > Take advantage of PREMIUM features for 12 months.<br>Create your texts &#x2F; logos without any limitation.<br>No attribution required when downloading.<br>No advertising on the website.<br> TextStudio.com  PREMIUM - Yearly Membership</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>You may show additional information on your Google Meet by zooming in and out.

Please note that you will need an iPhone <strong>running with iOS 7 and later.</strong>  Read along to get the steps and fix red eye with iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong> – tap on the “Photos” app in your iPhone. Post launching the app, look for the layered rectangles icon located at the bottom right corner of the screen. This icon is for “Albums”. Tap on it and proceed to the next step.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong> – Now, tap on “All Photos” appearing on the screen followed by choosing the image you wish to edit.</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong> – Choose the “Edit” option from the screen and then you are required to tap on the “Red Eye Correction” option. This eye correction icon will be the image of an eye from which a slanting line is crossing through it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/red-eye-correction-button-iphone.jpg"                                     ></p><p>Image resource: OS X Daily</p><p>Note: The “Red Eye Correction” option will not appear when the picture is captured without the use of flash. It will only be visible on the photos taken with flash and the screenshots.</p><p><strong>Step 4</strong> – After this, tap the red eye one by one and the red eye correction feature will change pixels as needed on the tapped area. You can tap eye once again if the edit was not of your preference.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong> – lastly, tap on the eye with slash icon i.e. “Red Eye Correction” icon to return to the main edit screen. Hit on “Done” once satisfied with the results.</p><p>If in case, you feel the changes are not according to what you needed, you can again go to the edit screen and hit on “Revert” option. This will restore the original picture.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://checkout.abbyy.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=39254762&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/0e5fb5c76fca16adbee503c9aff393cd/products/11_FR-Badges-NEW-FR-Standard-16-WIN-200.png"                      border="0"                > PDF application, powered by AI-based OCR, for unified workflows with both digital and scanned documents. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-5-Red-eye-remover-apps-for-iPhone"><a href="#Best-5-Red-eye-remover-apps-for-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Best 5 Red eye remover apps for iPhone"></a>Best 5 Red eye remover apps for iPhone</h2><p>After making you aware with the tutorial to remove red eye with iPhone Photos app, here are 5 red eye remover apps that will help you for the same.</p><h3 id="1-Adobe-Photoshop-Express"><a href="#1-Adobe-Photoshop-Express" class="headerlink" title="1.
