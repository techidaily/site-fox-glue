If you are a beginner then just 3D performance monitoring will be useful for you but for advanced users, features like classic HDMI color calibration and 4K upscaling are essential to maintain high picture quality at home screens. Same as internal specifications, you may find so many variations in port options and they must be considered on preferences during selection. Note that coaxial output will not be a good choice for high quality content but optical cables can ensure theatre like setup.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2036496/19272" target="_top" id="2036496">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2036496" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2036496/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Support-for-Streaming-Apps"><a href="#Support-for-Streaming-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Support for Streaming Apps"></a>Support for Streaming Apps</h3><p>These Blu-Ray players are not just limited to movie playbacks rather they can also provide advanced home theatre experience with easy access to Netflix and Hulu based streaming.</p><h3 id="DLNA-Support"><a href="#DLNA-Support" class="headerlink" title="DLNA Support"></a>DLNA Support</h3><p>If you are a professional then you may also demand DLNA support on your player so that multimedia content can be easily streamed on local network at your TV screen.

You must pick the one with minimal cabling requirement and a lightweight design. Note that, multipurpose type models are designed with unique combinations of 3D functionality and all other essential features including streaming capabilities but these units naturally grow up bigger in size.</p><h3 id="Are-the-New-4K-3d-Blu-ray-Players-worth-Buying"><a href="#Are-the-New-4K-3d-Blu-ray-Players-worth-Buying" class="headerlink" title="Are the New 4K 3d Blu-ray Players worth Buying?"></a>Are the New 4K 3d Blu-ray Players worth Buying?</h3><p>You can enjoy 4K experience on HD TVs and it offers quality much higher than 1080p or 720p.

Compared with other 360-degree cameras, it’s shape is very unique and crashproof. Below are the complete specs, pros and cons, reviews and suggestions about Giroptic 360cam, hope these can give you a reference if you want to buy a 360-degree camera.</p><p><strong>Related article:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 5 360 Degree Action Cameras &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1:Complete Review</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2:Pros and Cons at a glance</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3:Basic specs</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4:Should I buy</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Complete-Review-of-Giroptic-360cam"><a href="#Part-1-Complete-Review-of-Giroptic-360cam" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Complete Review of Giroptic 360cam"></a>Part 1: Complete Review of Giroptic 360cam</h2><p> <strong>Brief introduction</strong></p><p> Giroptic 360cam is the first consumer-ready camera that was born out of a Kickstarter campaign two years ago that brought in $ 1.4 million of crowdfunding. With access to this affordable full HD camera one no longer needs expensive camera rigs and post-processing software to create 360 degree images or videos with Virtual Reality (VR) experience. Armed with three equidistant optical lenses and three microphones, it records full spherical videos and high quality JPEG images that can be shared via your smartphone or computers without any extra software.</p><p> <strong>Design</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/giroptic-360cam-details.png"                      alt="Giroptic Design"                ></p><p> The funky pear or egg shaped design of Giroptic 360cam not only makes it totally compact and compatible to all kinds of environments and uses but also quite unique in the market. While the top houses the lenses, the bottom third of the body is detachable and holds that battery and the micro-SD card. The tripod mount and the Ethernet port are also located at the bottom of the camera. The black rubber coating makes it extremely suitable for rugged use and also water-resistant; it can survive up to 30 feet deep underwater for 30 minutes.</p><p> <strong>How to use it</strong></p><p> Operating Giroptic is very easy as it is essentially one-button process. You only need to press once to record, once to stop; leave the stitching and processing of the frames to your camera. The stitched videos&#x2F;images will be automatically ready to be uploaded to social sites.</p><p> Apart from the button to start&#x2F;stop recording, there’s another small button in the camera that lets you switch between different shooting modes like Video, Photo, Burst and Timelapse.</p><p> It uses a small LED display to show you the current shooting mode and the power level of the camera.</p><p> An inbuilt adaptor allows you to look at photos as soon as you take them and decide whether to delete the unwanted photos.</p><p> <strong>Where to use Giroptic 360cam</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/giroptic-360cam-where-to-use.JPG"                      alt="Giroptic- Where to use"                ></p><p> Giroptic 360cam is capable of functioning as a good surveillance camera in your home or workspace. This smart camera can be the diligent record-keeper of all your important business meetings, travels, memorable gathering of family and friends or any sports event.</p><p> <strong>Video and Image Quality</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/giroptic-360-cam-image-quality.jpg"                      alt="Giroptic- image quality"                ></p><p> The camera can capture 4K photos at up to three shots per second and record 2K videos at 30 frames per second. However, its maker Ollier admits that Giroptic 360cam can’t compete with high-end professional 360 cams of Nikon or GoPro. The 2K videos created by the camera have slightly visible stitching lines. However, the sophisticated digital stabilization technology used in the camera ensures that the processed footages run smooth and look good. For amateur shooting purposes, it is no doubt the best!</p><p> <strong>How to edit</strong></p><p> You don’t need any extra software or external accessory to process the captured images and videos and stitch them into single 360-degree spherical shot. Your Giroptic cam will do that automatically and make the stitched video file ready for social media sites like YouTube, Facebook and Instagram right in the camera itself. It is a smart gadget that knows which sites accept what file formats.</p><p> With the help of the Giroptic’s mobile app lets you can easily adjust a few settings, activate camera stabilization during a live feed.</p><p> The stitched photos and videos can be easily transferred to any device including smartphones, tablets, PCs and virtual reality headsets.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/2139558/4704" target="_top" id="2139558">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-2139558" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/2139558/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Pros-and-Cons-of-Giroptic-360cam-at-a-glance"><a href="#Part-2-Pros-and-Cons-of-Giroptic-360cam-at-a-glance" class="headerlink" title="Part 2:Pros and Cons of Giroptic 360cam at a glance"></a>Part 2:Pros and Cons of Giroptic 360cam at a glance</h2><p> Giroptic 360cam provides you with a number of definite advantages over its competitors in the market.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Replaceable battery&#x2F;SD card</td><td>Video isn’t as detailed as that from other 360-degree cameras</td></tr><tr><td>Water-resistant</td><td>Has trouble stitching video</td></tr><tr><td>Light bulb and Ethernet accessories</td><td>Quite expensive</td></tr><tr><td>Takes true 360-degree images</td><td>Low video quality</td></tr><tr><td>Has an impressive storage space.</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Live stream feature</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Rubberized skin.</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Has a universal mount and micro USB port.</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Its egg shaped design makes it compact and portable.</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Shock and water resistant.</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>360cam has native apps both for Android and iOS mobile devices.</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Stitching done in-camera</td><td>-</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1815679/21290" target="_top" id="1815679">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1815679" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://versadesk.pxf.io/i/5597632/1815679/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Basic-specs-of-Giroptic-360cam"><a href="#Part-3-Basic-specs-of-Giroptic-360cam" class="headerlink" title="Part 3:Basic specs of Giroptic 360cam"></a>Part 3:Basic specs of Giroptic 360cam</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Full name</th><th>Giroptic 360cam</th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Price</td><td>Official: $499</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Basic specifications</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Date Available</td><td>2016-05-24</td><td>Manufacturer</td><td>Giroptic</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>180g</td><td>Size</td><td>70x70x71 mm</td></tr><tr><td>Memory</td><td>internal standard SD card slot support is up to 128GB</td><td>Accessible</td><td>WIFI&#x2F;In-built GPS</td></tr><tr><td>Battery</td><td>Rechargeable Li-ion Battery 1180mAH, 3.7V up to 1 hour in video mode</td><td>Body material</td><td>Magnesium alloy and rubber</td></tr><tr><td>Sensor</td><td>custom-made CMOS sensors</td><td>Lenses</td><td>Three 185 degree fisheye lenses</td></tr><tr><td>Image resolution</td><td>Max 4096 x 2048</td><td>Video resolution</td><td>Max 2048 x 1024</td></tr><tr><td>Aspect Ratio</td><td>16:9</td><td>Tripod Mount</td><td>regular mount thread</td></tr><tr><td>Image format</td><td>JPEG</td><td>Video file format</td><td>Video file format</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1975562">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975562.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1975562">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975562.png"                      style="border: none;

With its shock and water resistant features and the tough rubber coating on the body, it is certainly more durable than many other cameras in the market. Although Giroptic is costlier than LG’s 360-degree camera, the video captured by the former is much better in quality. Finally, Giroptic 360cam is more versatile and resistant to elements than most of its near competitors. It is no doubt an all-purpose 360-degree cam that will provide you with a faithful 360-degree experience.</p><p> Check this video to watch a full review of Giroptic 360cam</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2132162/7443" target="_top" id="2132162">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2132162" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2132162/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/new-exploring-gradual-echo-deactivation-in-audacity/"><u>[New] Exploring Gradual Echo Deactivation in Audacity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-explore-the-world-of-custom-thumbnails-top-6-tools-reviewed/"><u>[Updated] Explore the World of Custom Thumbnails - Top 6 Tools Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-prepare-your-fb-content-hv-orientation-matters-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] How to Prepare Your FB Content H/V Orientation Matters for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/updated-rhythmic-beak-boogie-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Rhythmic Beak Boogie for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/updated-uncompromised-audio-with-ffmpegs-extraction-features-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Uncompromised Audio with FFmpeg's Extraction Features for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-troubleshooting-receiving-yourself-in-a-facebook-live/"><u>2024 Approved Troubleshooting Receiving Yourself in a Facebook Live</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discover-guides.techidaily.com/dvd-ripping-made-simple-extracting-your-favorite-holiday-films-from-a-windows-10-pc/"><u>DVD Ripping Made Simple: Extracting Your Favorite Holiday Films From a Windows 10 PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-download.techidaily.com/get-your-hp-envy-5660-up-to-speed-with-a-simple-driver-update/"><u>Get Your HP Envy 5660 Up to Speed with a Simple Driver Update!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/in-2024-9-pinnacle-in-live-game-broadcasting/"><u>In 2024, 9 Pinnacle in Live Game Broadcasting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/in-depth-analysis-why-apples-latest-inexpensive-ipad-surpasses-expectations-in-performance-and-features/"><u>In-Depth Analysis: Why Apple's Latest Inexpensive iPad Surpasses Expectations in Performance and Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/install-and-utilize-microsoft-copilot-a-macos-manual/"><u>Install and Utilize Microsoft Copilot: A macOS Manual</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-deluxe.techidaily.com/mastering-the-art-of-setting-bookmarks-in-your-flipbook-a-comprehensive-guide/"><u>Mastering the Art of Setting Bookmarks in Your FlipBook: A Comprehensive Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/securing-your-work-top-10-photo-watermark-solutions/"><u>Securing Your Work Top 10 Photo Watermark Solutions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/sj-cam-s6-unboxed-a-full-evaluation-in-detail-for-2024/"><u>SJ-CAM S6 Unboxed A Full Evaluation in Detail for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/top-10-free-harmonies-for-deep-calm-meditation-sessions/"><u>Top 10 Free Harmonies for Deep, Calm Meditation Sessions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/unleashing-your-cameras-potential-with-top-rated-drones-gimbals/"><u>Unleashing Your Camera's Potential with Top-Rated Drones Gimbals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/updated-take-your-editing-to-the-next-level-5-expert-final-cut-pro-tips/"><u>Updated Take Your Editing to the Next Level 5 Expert Final Cut Pro Tips</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

According to the German director Werner Herzog, we have a nice technology but we do not have any idea about how to fill that technology with content. While in one hand developers are a bit confused regarding the development of a VR game and on the other hand, users are frustrated with the quantity of content. But the scenario will soon change expected by the experts.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="The-cost-of-creating-VR-content-is-too-high"><a href="#The-cost-of-creating-VR-content-is-too-high" class="headerlink" title="The cost of creating VR content is too high"></a>The cost of creating VR content is too high</h2><p> There is very little doubt regarding the acceptability and advancement of this technology but there are some bitter realities about this technology that users have to accept. The very first one is the cost. There is no denying that the cost of making a VR game or video is quite a few times higher than normal. So, the developers have to think of it in advance and if they are not a big company, it becomes difficult most of the time. What if the VR game or movie flops? It is quite possible and in such situations, managing the money becomes really very difficult. And there is time concern as well. And according to the market experts, the return on investment is very low. So, the developers who will be crating the VR games will be in fix whether that will make them profit or not.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/resource/vr-bitter-reality.jpg"                      alt="vr-bitter-reality "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2016170/19272" target="_top" id="2016170">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2016170" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2016170/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-quality-of-VR-headset-is-not-stable"><a href="#The-quality-of-VR-headset-is-not-stable" class="headerlink" title="The quality of VR headset is not stable"></a>The quality of VR headset is not stable</h2><p> Well, now let’s focus on the quality of the VR headsets. Hundreds of companies are there offering these headsets. All are claiming theirs to be the best but what is the truth? Many of them are not even close to the standard that the viewers expect. The problem mostly persists with the small companies. There is no issue with the big brands like Oculus, HTC, and PSVR. But if you want to compromise with the price, you will end buy buying a piece of crap. And then comes the question of content. You are spending hundreds of dollars for a VR headset and just within a month you are out of content. So, what is the point of buying one then? This makes the buyers really very confused. And to be very frank with you, there is no particular solution to it yet.</p><p> So, what should be done? Whether the buyers should buy costly headsets or they should buy a cheap one since they are going to experience the lack of content soon? Well, giving the answer may be a bit tough right at this moment but the scenario will change soon. VR video, 360 degree photography, these are still very new and should be given some time to explore. The method of VR video is still exploring, the camera angles, shooting angles, lights, requirements; everything is very much new and there is no set standard yet. But with the constant advancement, visitors will soon experience a whole new set of contents that will change their video watching and gaming experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/resource/vr-content-quality.jpg"                      alt="vr-content-quality "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1925484/19272" target="_top" id="1925484">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1925484" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1925484/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082542/7443" target="_top" id="2082542">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082542" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082542/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-rise-to-prominence-6-game-changing-approaches-for-instagram-verification-and-fan-increase/"><u>[New] In 2024, Rise to Prominence 6 Game-Changing Approaches for Instagram Verification & Fan Increase</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/new-quick-start-combining-mac-obs-and-streamlabs-power/"><u>[New] Quick Start Combining Mac, OBS & Streamlabs Power</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-ensuring-seamless-security-with-iphone-x-face-id-fixed/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Ensuring Seamless Security with iPhone X - Face ID Fixed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-crafting-the-next-big-thing-your-guide-to-youtubes-best-video-types/"><u>2024 Approved Crafting the Next Big Thing Your Guide to YouTube's Best Video Types</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-essential-devices-for-capturing-journeys/"><u>2024 Approved Essential Devices for Capturing Journeys</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-periscope-savvy-the-ultimate-operational-manual/"><u>2024 Approved Periscope Savvy The Ultimate Operational Manual</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-picart-strategies-for-stunning-image-purification/"><u>2024 Approved PicArt Strategies for Stunning Image Purification</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-revolutionize-video-crafting-mastering-the-integration-of-windows-11-and-storyremix/"><u>2024 Approved Revolutionize Video Crafting Mastering the Integration of Windows 11 & StoryRemix</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-storyboard-pro-for-win8/"><u>2024 Approved StoryBoard Pro for Win8</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/a-comprehensive-list-of-8-budget-friendly-srt-services/"><u>A Comprehensive List of 8 Budget-Friendly SRT Services</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/ultimate-guide-top-11-kid-easy-vlog-camcorders-waterproof-for-2024/"><u>Ultimate Guide Top 11 Kid-Easy Vlog Camcorders, Waterproof for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-layers-intricate-analysis-of-vegas-pro-21-for-2024/"><u>Unveiling the Layers Intricate Analysis of Vegas Pro '21 for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

In a new video, Microsoft wishes to remind users that a superior alternative to Windows Movie Maker is called Clipchamp. However, the demise of the 19-year-old program opened the door for alternative <strong>movie maker windows 11</strong>, which is included with Windows 11.</p><p>The corporation reportedly acquired the editing suite Clipchamp last year, and it is reportedly accessible as an “inbox” app for Windows 11. It will therefore be pre-installed alongside other applications like Microsoft Family. In Windows 11, Clipchamp is intended to take the place of Windows Movie Maker as a video editing program. A recognizable user interface, including templates, project bins, timeline, and more, is provided by Clipchamp for <strong>Windows movie maker 11</strong>. Styles, stock media, transitions and. Filters are all included in the asset libraries that are supplied.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Use-Clipchamp-Video-Maker"><a href="#Part-1-Use-Clipchamp-Video-Maker" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

In Windows 10 and Windows 11, you may create videos using the new program Clipchamp. The editing program Clipchamp, which Microsoft purchased last year, is superior to earlier programs like Windows Movie Maker.

Edit Videos in Windows 11 with Photos App</h2><p>Windows has always offered methods for searching and displaying photos because it is a relatively flexible operating system. However, with Windows 11, Microsoft tried combining browsing, organizing, and viewing into a single program and some simple editing.</p><p>The outcome, the innocently named “Photos” app, can be pretty confusing. You can do anything with your photographs and videos, thanks to the Photos experience. Compare, edit, view, construct albums and create movies with ease of your priceless memories. While keeping you involved in the experience, it displays all of the goods from that place and lets you navigate to other pictures.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1528688/16446" target="_top" id="1528688">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1528688" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1528688/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Add-the-file"><a href="#Add-the-file" class="headerlink" title="Add the file"></a>Add the file</h3><ul><li>You can tap on the “ADD” option, select “From the PC” from the overlay menu, and choose the desired video from the storage drive.</li><li>After importing the videos from photos, you can see the storyboard screen to edit the video.</li></ul><h3 id="Add-title-card"><a href="#Add-title-card" class="headerlink" title="Add title card"></a>Add title card</h3><ul><li>Tap on the “Add title card” option on your storyboard pane, which can result in adding some extra fame before selecting the video on the storyboard.</li></ul><h3 id="Add-color-pallete"><a href="#Add-color-pallete" class="headerlink" title="Add color pallete"></a>Add color pallete</h3><ul><li>Choose the desired color from your color palette to change the background.</li><li>You can tap on the “+” button under “Custom color” to choose the color by using the color picker.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134233/18498" target="_top" id="2134233">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134233" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134233/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Time-the-unwanted-parts"><a href="#Time-the-unwanted-parts" class="headerlink" title="Time the unwanted parts"></a>Time the unwanted parts</h3><ul><li>Tap on the “Trim” option and choose the file you wish to trim if you have various video files on the storyboard.</li><li>Then, click and hold your left mouse button and drag the pointer to adjust the clip.</li><li>After editing according to your preference, you can tap on the “Done” option.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082536/7443" target="_top" id="2082536">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082536" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082536/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Add-some-filters"><a href="#Add-some-filters" class="headerlink" title="Add some filters"></a>Add some filters</h3><ul><li>You can tap “Filters” on the storyboard pane, choose one, but tap on individual thumbnails on the sidebar.</li><li>After applying the preferred filter, tap on the “Done” button from the bottom section, and click on confirm and apply.</li></ul><h3 id="Export-the-video-1"><a href="#Export-the-video-1" class="headerlink" title="Export the video"></a>Export the video</h3><ul><li>After you are done with your edit, you can tap “Finish Video” on the top section of the window.</li><li>Choose video quality using the dropdown menu under the “Video quality” label.</li><li>Tap on the export button to export the video.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-Windows-11-Movie-Maker-Alternative"><a href="#Part-3-Windows-11-Movie-Maker-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Choosing the right one depending on your requirements plays the key role in determining your video capturing success.</p><p> Different Types of Camera Filters and their Uses:</p><p><strong>1. Red Filte:</strong> Works great for shooting in blue water.</p><p> Best Usage: Under natural, surround light in blue water. (no video flash lights)</p><p><strong>2. Magenta Filter:</strong> Necessary for shooting in green water</p><p> Best Usage: Under natural, surround light in green water. (no video flash lights)</p><p><strong>3. Macro Filter:</strong> Very essential for capturing small underwater subjects</p><p> Best Usage 1: Using macro with red filter is great idea so that you can shoot under natural light. (You do not need the video flashlights as the red filter produces the red color effect). You can also use the macro filter only. You can also use the red filter only avoiding the macro lens.<br>Also, check Switchblade- excellent among the GoPro filters for flexible adjustments for everything you need.</p><p> Best Usage 2: Use the macro filter alone with the video lights to achieve clear view of the minute details (maintain medium light availability to control the brightness effect)</p><p> Best Usage 3: Simply use the macro filter alone for topside clear view of small objects</p><p><strong>4. Switchblade 2.0 Filter:</strong> Gives you the facility to use macro and red filter together. You can also flip between red filter for shooting at wide-angle and the macro lens for capturing small subjects.</p><p> Best Usage 1: Use it without using the video lights to capture macro subjects</p><p> Best Usage 2: Disable the ‘fisheye effect’. Capture from a close angle to fill the entire frame with the main subject to show more detailed, refine and astonishing footage.</p><p><strong>5. Polarizing Filter:</strong> Use it for shooting topside photos and videos and control reflected sunlight</p><p> Best Usage: Shoot photos and videos topside in natural bright sunlight</p><p><strong>6. Neutral Density Filter:</strong>  Useful for taking topside videos to minimize the shutter speed</p><p> Best Usage 1: Take photos and videos of static subjects or the subjects requiring the blur effect to show continued time passage and speed effect<br>Best Usage 2: Capture prominent GoPro time lapse videos or get the best results when the camera mount is set on vibrating surface</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123730/7443" target="_top" id="2123730">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123730" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123730/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-dissective-review-of-sharex-criticism-and-substitutes-for-2024/"><u>[New] Dissective Review of ShareX Criticism & Substitutes for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-best-practices-for-drone-cinematography/"><u>[New] In 2024, Best Practices for Drone Cinematography</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/n-2024-the-gateway-to-youtube-stardom-via-studio-expertise/"><u>[New] In 2024, The Gateway to YouTube Stardom via Studio Expertise</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-elite-camera-tech-review/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Elite Camera Tech Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-easyshadecleanse-professionally-crafted-erase-software/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, EasyShadeCleanse Professionally Crafted Erase Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/2024-approved-insight-into-lgs-360-camera-updates-and-features-for-todays-photographers/"><u>2024 Approved Insight Into LG's 360 Camera Updates and Features for Today's Photographers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-ultimate-guide-to-professional-gopro-video-making/"><u>2024 Approved The Ultimate Guide to Professional GoPro Video Making</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/appreciation-roundup-premiumfree-outro-templates-for-2024/"><u>Appreciation Roundup Premium/Free Outro Templates for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/dive-into-aurora-hdr-a-new-era-for-viewers-for-2024/"><u>Dive Into Aurora HDR A New Era for Viewers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/24-keeping-cameras-steady-in-motion-landscapes/"><u>In 2024, Keeping Cameras Steady in Motion Landscapes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-step-by-step-vivacut-video-editing-complete-guide-for-24/"><u>In 2024, Step-by-Step VivaCut Video Editing Complete Guide for '24</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techtrends.techidaily.com/1722873513289-microsoft-teams-not-working-determining-whether-you-or-their-servers-are-at-fault/"><u>Microsoft Teams Not Working?

Probably, you are also a big fan of VLC but the strange fact is that you are unaware about its incredible features. Yeah! There are so many things hidden inside VLC platform, the article below will help you to explore some of the most interesting features out of this big list.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="10-Useful-Hidden-Features-of-VLC"><a href="#10-Useful-Hidden-Features-of-VLC" class="headerlink" title="10 Useful Hidden Features of VLC"></a>10 Useful Hidden Features of VLC</h2><h3 id="1-Creating-Audio-and-Video-Effects"><a href="#1-Creating-Audio-and-Video-Effects" class="headerlink" title="1. Creating Audio and Video Effects"></a>1. Creating Audio and Video Effects</h3><p>Many times we feel like audio and video on a media file are not well synchronised and it appears very annoying. Most of you might be curious to get an idea about how to fix trouble and further you may also want to add few new effects to develop customized videos. To do this, simply open VLC media player on your system and then navigate to Tools option. Now hit the Effects and Filters option from dropdown menu. Further, select video effect or audio effect (whichever you want to adjust). It will allow users to apply wide range of effects and one can also view the changes side by side. It is much easier to adjust parameters like hue and brightness etc on VLC media player. Move to Synchronization tab to get your audio and video files perfectly synchronised, the action will be accomplished within few seconds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/creating-audio-and-video-effects.jpg"                      alt="creating-audio-and-video-effects "                ></p><h3 id="2-Record-Your-Desktop"><a href="#2-Record-Your-Desktop" class="headerlink" title="2.

Record Your Desktop</h3><p>It is good to know that VLC possess a superior screen recorder inside that can pick videos from your desktop while acting like a screen recorder tool. If you want to enable desktop recording on VLC then simply go to Media option and then move to Convert&#x2F;Save.

As it is recording live pictures iPhone device already captures the 1.5 seconds leading to the shutter button press, and saves it along with the rest 1.5 seconds for image capture.</p><p> Sharing the photos is an interesting part and if you think you will be unable to share the iPhone live photos, then you are mistaken. You can share live photo to devices runing iOS 9 or above. The OS X El Capitan also supports sharing the Live photos.</p><p> Remember one thing that while you open the iPhone live photos app, the audio option is always switched on. So, whatever you speak, shout, or discuss will be clearly recorded in the video. Keep in mind that shouting at the top of your voice and asking a person to move so that you can click a great view or moving pictures on iPhone can spoil your live photos.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Expediting-Windows-File-Reviews-with-Ease"><a href="#Expediting-Windows-File-Reviews-with-Ease" class="headerlink" title="Expediting Windows File Reviews with Ease"></a>Expediting Windows File Reviews with Ease</h2><p>Windows operating system comes with an inbuilt file preview feature embedded in Explorer. This feature lets you preview documents and images before uploading them on apps like Skype, Facebook, and more. But what happens if you want to preview videos, audio, spreadsheets, ZIP, and more? In that case, install <strong>QuickLook for Windows</strong>. So, what exactly is <strong>QuickLook for Windows 10,</strong> and where can you get this app? For answers and more, read to the end.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Download-Quick-Look-App-on-Microsoft-Store"><a href="#Part-1-Download-Quick-Look-App-on-Microsoft-Store" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Download Quick Look App on Microsoft Store"></a>Part 1: Download Quick Look App on Microsoft Store</h2><p>If your computer is always handling documents, spreadsheets, PDFs, presentations, images, and other files, it’s probably time to install <strong>QuickLook for Mac</strong> and Windows. This intelligent program lets you quickly preview files without opening them on separate apps. Just think of it as the “file viewer” feature on Windows File Explorer, which allows you to view files before loading online or opening them on local apps. Of course, this can help you know which app can open the file and if it’s the correct file to open.</p><p>But although the inbuilt file viewer is excellent to use, it has limited capabilities. For example, you cannot preview zipped files. Also, this inbuilt function cannot preview media files like audio and video. For this reason, install QuickLook for Windows and preview everything on your PC. And by the way, it’s absolutely free to use and comes bundled with a media player to open compatible video and audio formats.</p><p>Below is how to install and use QuickLook by Paddy Xu:</p><p>Step1 Open Microsoft Store and search for QuickLook. Make sure you select the option published by Paddy Xu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/quicklook-for-windows-1.jpg"                      alt="search for quicklook for windows on Microsoft store"                ></p><p>Step2 Once you find QuickLook, click “Get it” to download and install the app in your Windows operating system. At around 60MB, installing this preview app should be quick and easy.</p><p>Step3 After successfully installing QuickLook, head to File Explorer and select any file you want to preview. Press the “Space” bar on your keyboard to view the file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/quicklook-for-windows-2.jpg"                      alt="preview video on quicklook for windows"                ></p><p>Unfortunately, you won’t preview the content inside the document file. Instead, you’ll only see details like the file type&#x2F;format, size, image name, and more. You can also directly choose the opening app. As for videos and audio, the media file will automatically play on the QuickLook media player. But don’t fret because the following section will teach you to read your documents, presentations, PDFs, and other files on QuickLook without opening the file.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Get-the-App-on-GitHub"><a href="#Part-2-Get-the-App-on-GitHub" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Get the App on GitHub"></a>Part 2: Get the App on GitHub</h2><p>If you can’t find QuickLook on Microsoft Store for one reason or another, download the program from GitHub. It’s an open-source community where millions of software developers converge to distribute and share their work. Here, you can download and install multiple desktop programs and plugins for free. However, you must be a registered member to contribute any content.</p><p>So, without wasting time, let’s go through the steps to download the QuickLook plugin from GitHub.

Then, tap the space bar to preview the files. And remember, browse ZIP files to view all content.</p><p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: We recommend installing the QuickLook OfficeViewer plugin to rip open your Office files and view the content inside. This method is recommended if you haven’t installed Microsoft Office on your PC. However, you might notice that the OfficeViewer plugin isn’t supported on your Windows PC. So to install OfficeViewer, select the file and click the space bar to preview it on QuickLook. Then, tap the “Click here to install this plugin” button. Now restart QuickLook and view all your office documents without opening them on their respective programs.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Should-We-Expect-Built-in-Quick-Look-on-Windows-in-the-Future"><a href="#Part-3-Should-We-Expect-Built-in-Quick-Look-on-Windows-in-the-Future" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Should We Expect Built-in Quick Look on Windows in the Future?"></a>Part 3: Should We Expect Built-in Quick Look on Windows in the Future?</h2><p>Mac users have enjoyed the powerful QuickLook capabilities for at least 15 years. But are we going to see QuickLook coming to Windows 10&#x2F;11 anytime soon? According to sources, plans are already underway to add this feature to Microsoft Windows and rename it Peek. After selecting a file on Explorer, simply tap the Shift + Space bar to preview the content. Like the macOS version, you can preview PDFs, Excels, Words, images, videos, audio, and pretty much anything.</p><p>Meanwhile, it’s expected that QuickLook will come with a small preview screen. However, that should be enough space to preview whatever file you’re searching for. Also, it’s expected that Windows will embed the QuickLook capabilities into the Photos app. But it’s not yet clear if Peek will work with media files like videos and audio as it is on Mac.</p><p>In other related news, Microsoft will be answering the prayers of their loyal patrons to get tabbed browsing. This is another feature similar to what you currently have on macOS, where you can open new tabs for numerous file locations. In return, this makes moving and copying files more straightforward. This easy-to-navigate addition will definitely make Microsoft Windows users more productive than before.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135352/19272" target="_top" id="2135352">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135352" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135352/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Frequently-Asked-Questions"><a href="#Part-4-Frequently-Asked-Questions" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Frequently Asked Questions"></a>Part 4: Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h4 id="1-Which-digital-file-formats-are-compatible-with-QuickLook"><a href="#1-Which-digital-file-formats-are-compatible-with-QuickLook" class="headerlink" title="1.

For image formats, you can preview PNG, APNG, JPG, GIF, PSD, and MP4. You can also preview media files like MP3, M4A, MP4, MOV, AVI, WMV, and more. And, of course, QuickLook supports all sorts of document files, including PDF and CSV.

You need to keep in mind the fact that these drones aren’t expensive, not to mention you get only what the stuff you need. There’s no GPS connection or any other feature.

At around $49, this model is designed to bring in a 2MP camera as well as 5-8 minutes of flight time. It works great, it manages to bring in a resounding experience for all kids and it’s certainly one of the smallest drones out there with only 1.5 pounds in weight. The drone on its own has a 720p camera and at the same time you can man it with little to no effort. This is a very durable drone and the repairs that you get from it can be second to none. The charge time is also around 90 minutes, which seems to be ok.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Great camera, durable and stable, you can fly it indoors</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Considering that you get only 5 minutes of flight time or so, you need quite a lot of time to charge it.</p><h4 id="2-DBPower-X600C"><a href="#2-DBPower-X600C" class="headerlink" title="2.

You can even use the VR headset you have at home in order to experience full VR if you want. They added a headless mode, FPV real time transmission and the controls are very good too. Another thing to note about this particular drone is that it has 10 minutes of flight time and 720p video recording. It’s certainly worth your time if you are a drone fan, not to mention that maneuvering it is very easy. The FPV system does a very good job but the 0.3 MP camera does show its limitations. Still, you can easily operate it outdoors without a problem and with a bit of attention you can even man it indoors as well. This is certainly worth your time and the price of under $80 is very good considering what this drone can do for you.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> great flight time, VR support, FPV support</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> The camera is rather limited</p><h4 id="3-Air-Hogs-Star-Wars"><a href="#3-Air-Hogs-Star-Wars" class="headerlink" title="3.

It has LED lights, it even features Star Wars sounds and moving this around is really nice as well. They did a very good job at offering you a delightful and unique experience, not to mention that the quality on its own can be very distinct to begin with. The drone doesn’t cause damage if it loses control and overall you will be rather impressed with the experience as a whole. The drone doesn’t have a camera, but it does feature around 8 minutes of flight time and at 64 grams it really is one of the most interesting options for sure.

Pure color background"></a>1. Pure color background</h3><p>You can choose any clean and solid color wall, curtain, or wallpaper as a background for your live stream. But make sure that it is neat enough and has a broad field of vision. Moreover, there is no exposure to it.</p><p>It will be best to choose one that can easily match any color. But remember, do not use pure white backgrounds as they are too reflective, which is not suitable for the vision of your stream as it affects the highlight of the streamer and the products very much.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/best-backgrounds-for-live-streaming-1.jpg"                      alt="pure color background"                ></p><h3 id="2-Neatly-organized-shelves"><a href="#2-Neatly-organized-shelves" class="headerlink" title="2. Neatly organized shelves"></a>2. Neatly organized shelves</h3><p>Another way is to choose well-organized and clean shelves as a background. For example, you can set a bookshelf as your background if you have to join some live business meetings or academic sessions.</p><p>Even if you are a seller showcasing his products during a live stream, you can select this type of background by placing the products you will introduce on any clean shelf. It will help you to make the viewer experience much better.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/best-backgrounds-for-live-streaming-2.jpg"                      alt="neatly organized shelves"                ></p><h3 id="3-The-real-scene-with-warm-decoration"><a href="#3-The-real-scene-with-warm-decoration" class="headerlink" title="3.

They make your relationship with the viewers much more friendly and familiar. In other words, they give your stream a natural look, which fascinates the viewers very much.</p><p>One thing you guys should never forget is that you have to decorate the scene according to your stream category and characteristics. But not too many decorations are needed as it is much better if it looks natural.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/best-backgrounds-for-live-streaming-3.jpg"                      alt="the real scene with warm decoration"                ></p><h3 id="4-Virtual-backgrounds"><a href="#4-Virtual-backgrounds" class="headerlink" title="4. Virtual backgrounds"></a>4. Virtual backgrounds</h3><p>This is the best option for gamers and technology streamers. Using this feature, you can change your background anytime with any beautiful wallpaper or image you want. They can give your viewers a better visual appearance and a trustful impression. That is why live streams are also very important for large businesses.</p><p>Also, there are two kinds of virtual backgrounds. The first is a static image in which you can directly upload the wallpaper you want. The second option is the green screen, which is preferable to the latter. Because it allows you to use much more appealing and awesome backgrounds in your stream, as well as more accurate image matting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/best-backgrounds-for-live-streaming-4.jpg"                      alt="virtual backgrounds"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135416/19272" target="_top" id="2135416">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135416" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="336" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135416/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-II-5-tools-to-inspire-your-ideas-of-live-streaming-background"><a href="#Part-II-5-tools-to-inspire-your-ideas-of-live-streaming-background" class="headerlink" title="Part II. 5 tools to inspire your ideas of live streaming background"></a>Part II. 5 tools to inspire your ideas of live streaming background</h2><h3 id="1-Freepik"><a href="#1-Freepik" class="headerlink" title="1.

For older versions, you have to get Filmora v10.5. Also, Boris FX and NewBlue FX are available on specific devices.</p><p>However, you can <strong>convert AVI to GIF</strong> format on most Mac systems without any error unless you are using advanced functions like BorisFX on your Mac device with M1 chipsets.

On the other hand, a GIF is a type of bitmap image file format, created under a CompuServe team with Steve Wilhite, a capable computer scientist from the United States, at the helm of the project.</p><p>So, in essence, both are vastly different, but have commonalities in certain aspects. For AVI to GIF conversion, knowing what they are should help.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Parameter of Comparison</strong></th><th><strong>GIF</strong></th><th><strong>AVI</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Created by</strong></td><td>CompuServ</td><td>Microsoft</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Date of Development</strong></td><td>June 15, 1987</td><td>November 10, 1992</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Latest Update Date</strong></td><td>1989</td><td>1996</td></tr><tr><td><strong>File Extension</strong></td><td>.GIF</td><td>.AVI</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sharing Speed</strong></td><td>It is easy and fast to share GIF files between devices due to their smaller size.</td><td>Since the file is larger in size, the overall speed of transfer would be high.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Type of Format</strong></td><td>Bitmap lossless image format</td><td>Container format</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Container For</strong></td><td>-</td><td>Video, audio</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pros</strong></td><td>Compressed file (small size)</td><td>High-quality resolution of the video (upto 4K&#x2F;8K)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Cons</strong></td><td>It does not allow much editing.</td><td>The file size can get to very big size limits.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Support for B-Frames</strong></td><td>B-framing is compatible with GIFs.</td><td>It was not made with b-frames in consideration but can work with it.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Maximum Duration Supported</strong></td><td>The GIF files can extend to 15 seconds maximum.</td><td>The length and duration of these files a user can prepare&#x2F;keep depend on their limit of file storage capacity.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Variable Bit Rate Audio</strong></td><td>Not supported.</td><td>It can be detected in AVI and is generally non-standard.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Variable Frame Rate</strong></td><td>GIFs calculate delay render duration per frame, and they run in milliseconds.

On the other hand, a GIF is a type of bitmap image file format, created under a CompuServe team with Steve Wilhite, a capable computer scientist from the United States, at the helm of the project.</p><p>So, in essence, both are vastly different, but have commonalities in certain aspects. For AVI to GIF conversion, knowing what they are should help.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Parameter of Comparison</strong></th><th><strong>GIF</strong></th><th><strong>AVI</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Created by</strong></td><td>CompuServ</td><td>Microsoft</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Date of Development</strong></td><td>June 15, 1987</td><td>November 10, 1992</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Latest Update Date</strong></td><td>1989</td><td>1996</td></tr><tr><td><strong>File Extension</strong></td><td>.GIF</td><td>.AVI</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sharing Speed</strong></td><td>It is easy and fast to share GIF files between devices due to their smaller size.</td><td>Since the file is larger in size, the overall speed of transfer would be high.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Type of Format</strong></td><td>Bitmap lossless image format</td><td>Container format</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Container For</strong></td><td>-</td><td>Video, audio</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pros</strong></td><td>Compressed file (small size)</td><td>High-quality resolution of the video (upto 4K&#x2F;8K)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Cons</strong></td><td>It does not allow much editing.</td><td>The file size can get to very big size limits.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Support for B-Frames</strong></td><td>B-framing is compatible with GIFs.</td><td>It was not made with b-frames in consideration but can work with it.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Maximum Duration Supported</strong></td><td>The GIF files can extend to 15 seconds maximum.</td><td>The length and duration of these files a user can prepare&#x2F;keep depend on their limit of file storage capacity.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Variable Bit Rate Audio</strong></td><td>Not supported.</td><td>It can be detected in AVI and is generally non-standard.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Variable Frame Rate</strong></td><td>GIFs calculate delay render duration per frame, and they run in milliseconds.
