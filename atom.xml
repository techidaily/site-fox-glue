The best part is that the website is ad-free, which means you can easily browse all the textures without these annoying ads trying to distract you.</p><p><strong>Our Verdict</strong></p><p>If flexibility is your primary goal, Textures.com is a must-try. Upon signing up for a free account, it offers 15 credits each day to download HDRI and texture for your projects. The HDRIs are available at a low resolution, but with a premium subscription, you can download high-resolution images.</p><h3 id="Hdri-Skies"><a href="#Hdri-Skies" class="headerlink" title="Hdri-Skies"></a><a class="link"   href="https://hdri-skies.com/" >Hdri-Skies <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/top-10-websites-for-sky-hdr-images-2.jpg"                      alt="hdri skies"                ></p><p>Rating: 4.5&#x2F;5</p><p>Hdri-Skies is a premium website focusing on outdoors and open sky HDRI.

It can be intimidating to choose a sky map from such a vast collection; therefore, the website offers filters to choose an HDRI from a specific moment of the day.</p><p>Signing up with a free account allows a free, instant 2k download.

There are so many ways to search memes for iPhone; let’s look at the inbuilt options that Apple has given along with some of the most used third-party applications. Memes for iPhone come with extra clarity and more fun.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="How-to-find-the-iMessage-GIF-keyboard"><a href="#How-to-find-the-iMessage-GIF-keyboard" class="headerlink" title="How to find the iMessage GIF keyboard?"></a>How to find the iMessage GIF keyboard?</h2><p>If you are using ios10 or more, you have a GIF keyboard attached to the messaging app with the name of #images.

Memes made through this app show a watermark at the left bottom corner that says ‘made with Mematic.’ In 2012, iOS brought this app into use. After three years of service, this app was later updated so that android users could use it as well. This app is similar to other meme applications that provide different GIFs and images.</p><p>In the beginning, the users need to select a style of image macro that includes a demotivational poster, tweets, top and bottom text, breaking news, and many more. Users can either choose a photo of the folder given by the app, or they can also add it from the phone’s camera roll. They can also text and can reposition it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/mematic-app.jpg"                      alt="mematic app"                ></p><p><strong>Features of Mematic</strong></p><ul><li>Great workflow with a user-friendly interface.</li><li>Provides a great collection of graphic art, sketches, and funny photos.</li><li>Automated meme designer.</li><li>Allows you to add text to the image</li><li>Allows you to share on any platform</li><li>Offers a text editor that allows you to change the text’s color, font, and size.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://mematic.en.aptoide.com/app" >https://mematic.en.aptoide.com/app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="2-GIF-Memes-app"><a href="#2-GIF-Memes-app" class="headerlink" title="2.

For example, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) mandates all member states to harmonize their data privacy laws. In addition, it requires organizations to issue you a privacy notice that is transparent, concise, and easily accessible. Unfortunately, companies like Facebook continue to face criticism for breaching these laws through features like Off Facebook Previews.</p><p>If you are unfamiliar with the feature, the following information is extremely useful. As you keep reading, you will discover what “off Facebook preview” is and how it affects your data protection. Furthermore, there is a detailed guide on how to deactivate the feature in your account.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part1-What-is-Off-Facebook-Preview"><a href="#Part1-What-is-Off-Facebook-Preview" class="headerlink" title="Part1: What is Off-Facebook Preview?"></a>Part1: What is Off-Facebook Preview?</h2><p>Off-Facebook Previews are a record of all your activities outside the platform. Different companies offer this information to Facebook using their business tools, such as App Events, Offline Conversions, and Meta Pixel.</p><p>So, what information does the Off-Facebook Previews capture? According to Facebook, the feature allows them to collect:</p><ul><li>The number of times you open their client’s app on your device.</li><li>Your shopping cart history.</li><li>Your search history. For example, your local retailer can submit your search history to Facebook if their website uses some of their technology to run it.</li><li>A record of all apps and websites where you use your Facebook credentials to log in. Typically, the information comes from companies offering Facebook Login as one of their single sign-on (SSO) methods.</li><li>Your donation and content viewing activity from companies that use Facebook API in their websites and apps.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148771/18498" target="_top" id="2148771">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2148771" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="350" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148771/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part2-Should-I-Leave-Off-Facebook-Activity-be-on-or-off"><a href="#Part2-Should-I-Leave-Off-Facebook-Activity-be-on-or-off" class="headerlink" title="Part2: Should I Leave Off Facebook Activity be on or off?"></a>Part2: Should I Leave Off Facebook Activity be on or off?</h2><p>As you can see, Off Facebook Previews collects lots of your sensitive information from its clients.

In addition, it further emphasizes this through its Privacy Policy, and the <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/off%5Ffacebook%5Factivity" >What is off-Facebook activity <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li>In addition, the company strictly prohibits its clients from sharing sensitive information through the Off-Facebook Previews feature. Some of the sensitive information it prohibits includes your medical history, financial information, birthday, and user credentials.</li><li>Furthermore, any organization using Facebook’s business tools must clearly state this information with their clients before activating their subscription. Failure to do so can lead to immediate service discontinuation or legal liability in extreme cases.</li><li>Moreover, the company allows you to manage your Off-Facebook activity directly from your profile. For example, you can use the Clear Previous activity option to erase all previous data or use the Disconnect Future activity function to prevent further data collection.</li><li>Finally, the company openly shares a record of the information it receives from its clients through the <strong>Recent Activity</strong> Please refer to the <strong>What is Off-Facebook Preview</strong> section to discover what user information the company shares in your recent activity report.</li></ul><h2 id="FAQs"><a href="#FAQs" class="headerlink" title="FAQs"></a>FAQs</h2><h4 id="Is-the-Off-Facebook-Previews-feature-safe"><a href="#Is-the-Off-Facebook-Previews-feature-safe" class="headerlink" title="Is the Off-Facebook Previews feature safe?"></a>Is the Off-Facebook Previews feature safe?</h4><p>Not in its current state. Here are some of the reasons for this stance.</p><ul><li>It takes 48 hours for Facebook to disconnect you from the service fully. This gives them ample time to collect more personal information from you to further their business interests.</li><li>You will continue receiving ads from Facebook clients even when you deactivate the feature successfully. This is because the social media platform continues to collect your personal data if your account is active. For example, third-party advertisers can show you campaigns based on your Facebook group likes and interests.</li><li>You will need to create a new account for apps and websites where you used Facebook SSO. This is because disabling Off-Facebook Previews automatically signs you out from these accounts.</li><li>Despite several punishments from law enforcement, Facebook continues to face criticism for its poor data security protocols. For example, the company is issuing checks of up to $397 to its users, following an <a class="link"   href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/did-you-receive-a-illinois-facebook-settlement-check-in-the-mail-heres-why-and-what-to-know-about-it/2839499/" >agreement with the Illinois State Settlement Administrator for data privacy violations. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h4 id="Can-you-deactivate-Off-Facebook-Previews-for-specific-websites-and-apps"><a href="#Can-you-deactivate-Off-Facebook-Previews-for-specific-websites-and-apps" class="headerlink" title="Can you deactivate Off-Facebook Previews for specific websites and apps?"></a>Can you deactivate Off-Facebook Previews for specific websites and apps?</h4><p>Yes, you can disable your future off-Facebook activity for specific apps. Here is how you do it:</p><ol><li>Log in to your Facebook account, and choose <strong>Settings and Privacy</strong> from your profile picture drop-down menu.</li><li>Tap on the <strong>Settings</strong> option, and choose <strong>Privacy</strong> from the resulting menu.</li><li>Then, select the <strong>Off-Facebook Activity</strong>, followed by <strong>Explore Activity</strong>, on the next page.</li><li>Finalize the process by clicking the <strong>Select Future Activity to Disconnect</strong> button.</li></ol><h4 id="Do-you-need-to-repeat-the-process-for-different-platform-devices"><a href="#Do-you-need-to-repeat-the-process-for-different-platform-devices" class="headerlink" title="Do you need to repeat the process for different platform devices?"></a>Do you need to repeat the process for different platform devices?</h4><p>No. Facebook is a cross-platform program, meaning the changes apply to all devices you have access to. So, for example, Off-Facebook Previews will still be inactive on your desktop even when you make the change using your smartphone.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-top-7-best-drone-gimbals-in-the-market/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Top 7 Best Drone Gimbals in the Market</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/new-jest-in-imagery-create-with-kapwing-for-2024/"><u>[New] Jest in Imagery Create with Kapwing for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/new-maximizing-zoom-top-strategies-for-chromebooks/"><u>[New] Maximizing Zoom Top Strategies for Chromebooks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/new-the-virtual-vanguard-of-humor-your-blueprint-for-metaspace-meme-creation-for-2024/"><u>[New] The Virtual Vanguard of Humor – Your Blueprint for Metaspace Meme Creation for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-from-idea-to-screen-smartphone-video-creation-tips/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, From Idea to Screen Smartphone Video Creation Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/updated-leveraging-hdrs-potential-for-ultimate-video-visualization/"><u>[Updated] Leveraging HDR's Potential for Ultimate Video Visualization</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-personalized-content-sharing-on-vimeo-basic-plus-and-pro-explained-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Personalized Content Sharing on Vimeo Basic, Plus & Pro Explained for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/a-closer-look-at-the-acoustic-engineering-in-klipschs-flexus-200-soundbar/"><u>A Closer Look at the Acoustic Engineering in Klipsch's Flexus 200 Soundbar</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/cutting-edge-tips-for-low-cost-youtube-sessions/"><u>Cutting-Edge Tips for Low-Cost YouTube Sessions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/how-to-install-updated-epson-l3150-printer-drivers-on-windows-operating-systems-windows-1087/"><u>How to Install Updated Epson L3150 Printer Drivers on Windows Operating Systems (Windows 10/8/7)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/how-to-reverse-color-saturation-quickly-for-2024/"><u>How to Reverse Color Saturation Quickly for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-contacts-from-honor-90-lite-to-phone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Contacts from Honor 90 Lite To Phone | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-tips.techidaily.com/superior-cura-plugin-selection-for-improved-3d-printout-results/"><u>Superior Cura Plugin Selection for Improved 3D Printout Results</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

There are so many ways to search memes for iPhone; let’s look at the inbuilt options that Apple has given along with some of the most used third-party applications. Memes for iPhone come with extra clarity and more fun.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="How-to-find-the-iMessage-GIF-keyboard"><a href="#How-to-find-the-iMessage-GIF-keyboard" class="headerlink" title="How to find the iMessage GIF keyboard?"></a>How to find the iMessage GIF keyboard?</h2><p>If you are using ios10 or more, you have a GIF keyboard attached to the messaging app with the name of #images. If you don’t have one, you can also use a few 3rd party applications.</p><ul><li>Click on the messages and start composing a new one or continue with the existing message.</li><li>Tap the icon ‘A’ available to the text field’s left.</li><li>If the #images icon is not visible, press the icon with four bubbles on the bottom left corner.</li></ul><h2 id="1-Mematic"><a href="#1-Mematic" class="headerlink" title="1.

Memes made through this app show a watermark at the left bottom corner that says ‘made with Mematic.’ In 2012, iOS brought this app into use. After three years of service, this app was later updated so that android users could use it as well. This app is similar to other meme applications that provide different GIFs and images.</p><p>In the beginning, the users need to select a style of image macro that includes a demotivational poster, tweets, top and bottom text, breaking news, and many more. Users can either choose a photo of the folder given by the app, or they can also add it from the phone’s camera roll. They can also text and can reposition it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/mematic-app.jpg"                      alt="mematic app"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/c/5597632/1557747/17382" target="_top" id="1557747">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17382-1557747" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/i/5597632/1557747/17382"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Features of Mematic</strong></p><ul><li>Great workflow with a user-friendly interface.</li><li>Provides a great collection of graphic art, sketches, and funny photos.</li><li>Automated meme designer.</li><li>Allows you to add text to the image</li><li>Allows you to share on any platform</li><li>Offers a text editor that allows you to change the text’s color, font, and size.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://mematic.en.aptoide.com/app" >https://mematic.en.aptoide.com/app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="2-GIF-Memes-app"><a href="#2-GIF-Memes-app" class="headerlink" title="2.

Fresnel lens</strong></p><p>A Fresnel lens is an optional attachment that can bounce the light off of the ceiling of your studio and diffuses the light to look soft.</p><p><strong><em>2) Steps</em></strong></p><p>For this tutorial, we will use the Three-Point Lighting technique:</p><h5 id="Step1-Set-the-Key-Light"><a href="#Step1-Set-the-Key-Light" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Set the Key Light"></a>Step1 Set the Key Light</h5><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-1.jpg"                      alt="set the key light"                ></p><p>The key light is the main light that illuminates the subject. You can place it in the front and slightly to one side. For this key light, we use an LED called Aputure 300X as an example, and with a soft box called light Dome 2.</p><h5 id="Step2-Set-the-Fill-Light"><a href="#Step2-Set-the-Fill-Light" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Set the Fill Light"></a>Step2 Set the Fill Light</h5><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-2.jpg"                      alt="set the fill light"                ></p><p>The fill light is used to fill in the shadows created by the key light. It is usually placed on the opposite side of the subject. For the fill light, we use an Aputure 300D with a fresnel lens attachment.</p><h5 id="Step3-Set-the-Backlight"><a href="#Step3-Set-the-Backlight" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Set the Backlight"></a>Step3 Set the Backlight</h5><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-3.jpg"                      alt="set the backlight"                ></p><p>For this tutorial, we use Aperture 120d as the backlight and lift it up into the air with a c-stand so it can light the subject from above. It helps to separate the talent from the background and give the audience a full view of the set</p><h5 id="Step4-Use-Practical-Lights"><a href="#Step4-Use-Practical-Lights" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Use Practical Lights"></a>Step4 Use Practical Lights</h5><p>Practical lights appear on the camera to add some visual flair. It can be any light source that isn’t meant for lighting the subject. For example, we use a green lamp to help our background pop as it casts a nice orange light on the back wall.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-4.jpg"                      alt="use practical lights"                ></p><p>Then, we also have a LED ring light that shines toward the camera. The light adds even more light to the frame and gives a slight backlight to the subject.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-5.jpg"                      alt="led ring light"                ></p><p>Finally, we have a few other small LED lights like this unicorn to put in the background. This lighting helps us to get even more visual flair out of our shots.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-6.jpg"                      alt="other small led lights"                ></p><p>After setting up all the lighting above, you can take a look at the comparison below:</p><p><strong>Using Key Light only</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-7.jpg"                      alt="using key light only"                ></p><p><strong>Using Key Light + Fill + Backlight</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-8.jpg"                      alt="using key light + fill + backlight"                ></p><p><strong><em>3) Pro Tips: The light setting</em></strong></p><p>We usually set the lights around 50% brightness and a color temperature of 5600K.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-9.jpg"                      alt="the light setting"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135351/19272" target="_top" id="2135351">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135351" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135351/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>Hopefully, you learned something about lighting by taking a look at our setup.

The optics of iPhone cameras are without question powerful, but it is the combination of the software and the hardware that makes these cameras truly unique.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Camera Apps for iPhone X&#x2F;10&#x2F;8 Plus&#x2F;7 Plus <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Each iPhone photographer has to ask themselves the same question: ‘Am I really using the full capacity of my camera?’If the answer is no, maybe these iPhone camera features can help you improve the quality of your photos.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="10-iPhone-Camera-Features-You-Should-Know-in-iOS-11-1"><a href="#10-iPhone-Camera-Features-You-Should-Know-in-iOS-11-1" class="headerlink" title="10 iPhone Camera Features You Should Know in iOS 11"></a>10 iPhone Camera Features You Should Know in iOS 11</h2><p> The quality of your photos is in direct relation to your level of familiarity with the camera’s features because the more you know about the camera the better you will be at finding the proper use for those features.</p><h4 id="1-Don’t-Be-Shy-to-Use-the-Grid-Mode"><a href="#1-Don’t-Be-Shy-to-Use-the-Grid-Mode" class="headerlink" title="1.

Fortunately, the iPhone camera app offers the Grid Mode that divides the screen into nine equal parts. The grid will provide assistance in placing the subjects of your photos at the very center of the picture or when learning how to use the rule of thirds, one of the most basic composition techniques in photography.</p><h4 id="2-Set-the-Focus-and-Exposure-manually"><a href="#2-Set-the-Focus-and-Exposure-manually" class="headerlink" title="2.

Even though your iPhone is perfectly capable of setting the exposure or focus automatically, adjusting these values manually will provide you with more control over the process of taking a photo. Choosing where the focal point in your photo will be and finding the perfect exposure by yourself will allow you to highlight the subjects of your pictures and it will enable you to decide how bright or dark your photo is going to be.</p><h4 id="3-HDR-Photos-Have-More-Balanced-Lightning"><a href="#3-HDR-Photos-Have-More-Balanced-Lightning" class="headerlink" title="3.

When activated, HDR feature will allow your iPhone to combine three different exposures in a single shot, and the result will be a picture that has a higher amount of detail in its shadows and highlights.</p><h4 id="4-Use-the-Timer-to-Stabilize-Your-Shots"><a href="#4-Use-the-Timer-to-Stabilize-Your-Shots" class="headerlink" title="4.

This complicates things even further in difficult light conditions, but the Timer feature on iPhone X can help you solve this problem. You can compose your shot and set the Timer for 3 or 10 seconds and the device will take ten photos in a row, which will enable you to select the sharpest photo and delete the others.</p><h4 id="5-Edit-Live-Photos"><a href="#5-Edit-Live-Photos" class="headerlink" title="5.

Edit Live Photos</h4><p> Taking Live Photos hasn’t changed at all on the new model of the iPhone, but now you can also edit live photos in pretty much the same way you would edit a still photo. You can turn off the sound, crop or rotate live photos effortlessly, as well as apply filters, adjust color balance or improve lightning on all of your live photos.</p><h4 id="6-QR-Codes-Detection"><a href="#6-QR-Codes-Detection" class="headerlink" title="6.

The iOS 11 is the first iPhone OS with the ability to read QR codes. All you need to do is open your camera app and point it in the direction of the QR code you want to view, and your iPhone X will do the rest.</p><h4 id="7-Take-Selfies-in-Portrait-Mode-Only-for-iPhone-X"><a href="#7-Take-Selfies-in-Portrait-Mode-Only-for-iPhone-X" class="headerlink" title="7.

This iPhone X Portrait mode lets you control the depth of field, which means that objects closest to the lens are going to be crispy sharp, and the rest of the picture is going to have a smooth artistic blur.</p><h4 id="8-Improvements-of-the-Video-Features-iPhone-X-8"><a href="#8-Improvements-of-the-Video-Features-iPhone-X-8" class="headerlink" title="8.

These features are a significant step up from the previous iPhone model both in terms of video image quality and in terms of possibilities they provide to iPhone X owners.</p><h4 id="9-Dual-Optical-Image-Stabilization-Lets-you-Take-Better-Photos-iPhone-X-8"><a href="#9-Dual-Optical-Image-Stabilization-Lets-you-Take-Better-Photos-iPhone-X-8" class="headerlink" title="9.

The platform won’t make this option available if your primary audience is children or you are using a supervised account.</li><li>Your photo should not exceed 16 MB. Any image you upload above this upper limit will probably be cropped or fail to upload to the tab.</li><li>It would be best to ensure your aspect ratio is 1:1 because this is how they appear on the feed. You wouldn’t want the photo to appear zoomed in on the middle ground when you intended to show the entire picture.</li><li>The best file formats to upload to your Community Tab include GIF, JPG, WEBP, and PNG.</li><li>Ensure your photo doesn’t violate the YouTube Community Guidelines, lest the moderators take it down. In a worst-case scenario, you might receive a strike. We all know that three strikes will lead to the closure of your YouTube channel.</li></ul><h3 id="Method-2-Use-Image-to-Video-Makers-Online-to-Post-Pictures-on-YouTube"><a href="#Method-2-Use-Image-to-Video-Makers-Online-to-Post-Pictures-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Method 2.
