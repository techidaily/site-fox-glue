    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Adventure-Begins-with-Panasonic’s-HX-A1-Action-Recorder"><a href="#The-Adventure-Begins-with-Panasonic’s-HX-A1-Action-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="The Adventure Begins with Panasonic’s HX-A1 Action Recorder"></a>The Adventure Begins with Panasonic’s HX-A1 Action Recorder</h2><h1 id="Panasonic-HX-A1-Wearable-Action-Camera-Review"><a href="#Panasonic-HX-A1-Wearable-Action-Camera-Review" class="headerlink" title="Panasonic HX-A1 Wearable Action Camera Review"></a>Panasonic HX-A1 Wearable Action Camera Review</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><h5 id="Max-Wales"><a href="#Max-Wales" class="headerlink" title="Max Wales"></a>Max Wales</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p> Action camera market is benefitted because it gives the freedom to take all sorts of approaches when it comes to execution. There are undisputed leaders present in this segment but their product and price doesn’t fulfil the needs of each and every buyer. More choices always put pressure on leaders and consequently make the product better for the ultimate buyer! Panasonic has proved it yet again with its HX-A1 <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wearable Action Camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Polaroid XS 100 Review &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> With an unconventional cylindrical design, this digital camcorder is ready to make you fall for it. Panasonic has always tried to add versatility to their product and this focus has helped to win the hearts of its fans! HX-A1 Wearable Action Camera, as its name suggests, helps to mount it to any ideal spot. Its elongated torch-like shape helps in mounting it to your helmet, board or any other piece of mountain gear. You can attach it to your bag, hat or backpack or just put it like a headband! The twin mount helps in clicking in dark situations especially where you need an IR flashlight. Its 0 lux night vision mode allows IR flashlight to be mounted in addition to A1. The camera allows to film in 1080p at 30fps, 720p at 60fps and 480p at 240fps. Available at a very affordable price of $101.95, A1 is certainly compatible to exceed your expectations. Let us unfold aspects of this A1 camera in this post.</p><h2 id="Design-and-Usability"><a href="#Design-and-Usability" class="headerlink" title="Design and Usability"></a>Design and Usability</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/panasonic-hx-a1-design.jpg"                      alt="panasonic-hx-a1-design"                ></p><p> The elongated cylindrical body of this camera is very compact and less quirky and helps in operating it as a single component system. It is available in luminous orange and black colour variants and both of them look smart and classy. Its shock-proof, freeze-proof and dustproof makes it stand out exceptionally. It is compliant with IPX8 and thus you are free from hassles of adding a separate waterproof case! With a weight of only 45 gms, A1 is one of those few smallest action cameras which are easy and safe to carry. There is no built-in screen and the basic three buttons for its functioning rest on top of the camera, which can be termed as one of its shortcoming in design, as it tends to roll from sides when is set down, and thus can damage these controls if not kept carefully. These three buttons help in turning on the device, toggle recording and switch between video, still image and slow motion modes. Its built-in WiFi module allows the camera to connect to the smartphone and then transfer the media easily. This feature can also be used whenever you are framing up your shots, so you don’t feel lack of built-in screen.</p><h2 id="Specification"><a href="#Specification" class="headerlink" title="Specification"></a>Specification</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Review Price</th><th>$101.95 (Amazon)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Image sensor</td><td>1&#x2F;3-inch BSI CMOS with 3.54Mpixels</td></tr><tr><td>Lens</td><td>F2.8 120-150 angles</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>45g</td></tr><tr><td>Dimensions</td><td>84x26x26 cm</td></tr><tr><td>Battery</td><td>Built-in 480 mAh (3.7V) (Lating upto 70-90 minutes of continuous video recording)</td></tr><tr><td>Memory</td><td>Micro SD, upto 128GB</td></tr><tr><td>Video mode</td><td>1080P@30fps 720P@ 60&#x2F;30fps 480P@30fps</td></tr><tr><td>Recording format</td><td>.MP4 H2.64 JPEG</td></tr><tr><td>Resistance</td><td>Shockproof 1.5 m &#x2F; 5 ft; Freezeproof -10°C &#x2F; -14°F Dustproof IP68 compliant(IEC 60529)</td></tr><tr><td>Intermitting recording</td><td>5 sec, 10 sec, 30 sec, 60sec</td></tr><tr><td>Slow-motion recording modes</td><td>1280x720 60fps&#x2F;30fps</td></tr><tr><td>Features</td><td>Tripod and multi-option mounts included; Built-in WiFi and USB sharing; Wind Cut; Night Mode</td></tr><tr><td>Connectivity</td><td>Wi-Fi Micro-B USB</td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Pros</strong></th><th><strong>Cons</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>WiFi control via iOS and Android apps, makes it easy and possible to view, control and copy videos and still images wirelessly</td><td>Many settings only available via Image App and thus there is no real time connectivity</td></tr><tr><td>Waterproof, dustproof, shockproof and freeze proof.

The Infra-Red lens can be used with your IR flashlight for recording in 0 Lux night vision mode. This means that action doesn’t stop when the sun goes down. If you are the one who is willing to record after dark for that extra dimension then this night vision mode will prove to be ideal for camping, night hiking, caving adventures and filming nocturnal wildlife. Even though it requires purchase of compatible IR flashlight, it brings out the best in pictures.</p><p> A range of mounts are available but A1 comes packaged with only Multi and Tripod mounts. Using Multi-mount, you can mount A1 to any ideal spot. As mentioned earlier that it can be curvy or any flat surface. The mounts have a hoop which secures it firmly. Tripod Mount helps in opening up more possibilities of mounting.</p><h4 id="Other-Optional-Accessories"><a href="#Other-Optional-Accessories" class="headerlink" title="Other Optional Accessories"></a>Other Optional Accessories</h4><p> The rest of the Panasonic accessories have to be purchased separately as they can help in escalating the usefulness of this device.</p><h4 id="Extended-battery"><a href="#Extended-battery" class="headerlink" title="Extended battery"></a>Extended battery</h4><p> By adding weight of just 1.7 ounces to this 45g device, the extended battery of 750mAh adds upto 2.X more recording time which is worth investing! Also this lightweight and waterproof extra battery can be charged easily via micro USB.</p><h4 id="Twin-Mount"><a href="#Twin-Mount" class="headerlink" title="Twin Mount"></a>Twin Mount</h4><p> It holds both IR flashlight and camera for recording in dark conditions. It improves the recording experience in dark and also holds two cameras positioned in opposite directions for simultaneous front and rear recording.</p><h4 id="Handlebar-Mount"><a href="#Handlebar-Mount" class="headerlink" title="Handlebar Mount"></a>Handlebar Mount</h4><p> Suction cup and Handlebar mount helps in using the action camera while driving, boating, biking and kayaking as they securely mount on bike, ATV, motorcycle and other handlebars.</p><h4 id="Wind-jammer-and-strap-adapter"><a href="#Wind-jammer-and-strap-adapter" class="headerlink" title="Wind jammer and strap adapter"></a>Wind jammer and strap adapter</h4><p> Wind jammer and strap adapter can be other accessories which you can buy. Wind jammer help in making the audio clearer during windy conditions and strap adapter helps in connecting the camera to the floatation strap, neck strap or key ring. This pretty device is very catchy to the eyes, after all!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn more about Action Camera Accessories Buying Guide for 2017 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Features"><a href="#Features" class="headerlink" title="Features"></a>Features</h2><h4 id="1-Video-and-photo-quality"><a href="#1-Video-and-photo-quality" class="headerlink" title="1. Video and photo quality"></a><strong>1. Video and photo quality</strong></h4><p> The 2.6mm F2.8 lens and 1&#x2F;3-inch MOS sensor does a pretty notable job in recording 1080p Full HD video at 30 fps or 720p if you want 60 fps. Absence of 4K resolution and high competition really needed to deliver top-notch video quality. A1 complements very well with contrasts in brightness and its tender picture quality softens the detail a little. The point to be kept in mind is that Slow motion video recording is only available in the non-HD 480p resolution. It also allows you to continuously take 2.7-megapixel snapshots at a set interval. So its video and photo quality can be termed as decent!</p><h4 id="2-Night-Version"><a href="#2-Night-Version" class="headerlink" title="2. Night-Version"></a><strong>2. Night-Version</strong></h4><p> Not most of the action cameras in this range offer such a high quality feature of night mode. This means you can now fulfil your adventurous dreams of exploring caves and filming wildlife in the peek darkness. IR Filter and external Infrared light source makes it possible to make pictures and video lively. Addition of Night Vision IR lens is simply fantastic. This 0 Lux Night Mode helps to see in dark without compromising with picture quality. So now you are ready to shoot in total darkness.</p><p> Lookring for action camera with the ability to shoot under low light conditions? <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Check Olympus TG Tracker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="3-Battery-and-charging"><a href="#3-Battery-and-charging" class="headerlink" title="3. Battery and charging:"></a><strong>3. Battery and charging:</strong></h4><p> A small 480mAh battery is input in this device to keep it light in weight. However, that means that it can handle about 70-90 minutes of continuous HD video recording. The point worth noting fortunately is that it gets charged quickly. Also it uses micro-USB standard which means it is chargeable with the help of power-bank as well as solar panel. So battery is little disappointing but its extendable battery can double the shooting length.</p><h4 id="4-Twin-Camera-capture-Capacity"><a href="#4-Twin-Camera-capture-Capacity" class="headerlink" title="4. Twin-Camera capture Capacity:"></a><strong>4. Twin-Camera capture Capacity:</strong></h4><p> Panasonic HX-A1 can be linked up with a Wi-Fi enabled Panasonic camcorder, thanks to its twin camera capability. This dual angle recording with Wireless twin camera allows you to record simultaneously and what you get as a result is a picture which exceeds the definition of nicest! The digital recording improves the quality and liveliness of videos and images.</p><h4 id="5-Resistant-capacity"><a href="#5-Resistant-capacity" class="headerlink" title="5. Resistant capacity:"></a><strong>5. Resistant capacity:</strong></h4><p> The resistant capacity of this device evident that it is designed to endure extreme outdoor conditions of any adventure you put yourself through. SFDW is its formula! Shock, freeze, dust and water proof ability makes it out of the box. The A1 is IP68 compliant, which means it has a capacity down to a depth of 1.5 metres (5 feet) of water and completely dustproof. It’s also rated to survive drops of up to 1.5 metres and is freeze-proof to -10 degrees Celsius or 14 degrees Fahrenheit, so now you don’t need to cancel your plans due to extreme weather conditions. .</p><h4 id="6-Image-APP"><a href="#6-Image-APP" class="headerlink" title="6. Image APP"></a><strong>6. Image APP</strong></h4><p> A1 connectivity to the Image App eases out its usage drastically. It gives a gateway to adjust the resolution and also provides access to various white balance options including dalylight and cloudy for outdoor and some user and automatic configured ones for indoor shoots. This app can also be used for live preview and toggling record acting as camera’s screen after complete configuration.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> The minor drawbacks in A1 are completely understandable. With its decent picture quality and plenty of other features such as SFDW formula, it can be rightly said that Panasonic has created a fine budget camera which is worth investing. There is always a way to capture your fun and thrills and Panasonic HX-A1 gets along your making it a capable action camera!</p><p> Looking for action cameras with low budget? <a class="link"

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Streamline-Your-Day-Multitask-Mastery-for-the-Podcast-Aficionado"><a href="#Streamline-Your-Day-Multitask-Mastery-for-the-Podcast-Aficionado" class="headerlink" title="Streamline Your Day: Multitask Mastery for the Podcast Aficionado"></a>Streamline Your Day: Multitask Mastery for the Podcast Aficionado</h2><p>Using podcasts to learn and entertain is a great idea. Multitasking is also possible, which is convenient for people with little free time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-1.jpg"                      alt="podcast live"                ></p><p>So, to make the most of your time spent listening to podcasts, here are some ideas on what you can do while listening! Keep reading to find out more.</p><h2 id="When-Listening-to-a-Podcast-What-Is-Appropriate-To-Do"><a href="#When-Listening-to-a-Podcast-What-Is-Appropriate-To-Do" class="headerlink" title="When Listening to a Podcast, What Is Appropriate To Do?"></a>When Listening to a Podcast, What Is Appropriate To Do?</h2><p>You do not need to dedicate a specific time to listen to podcasts. The entire idea of the podcast is auto-based information and shows to entertain users while doing something tedious and tiresome.</p><p>It allows you to fill those moments by learning new things and improving cognitive skills. Plus, it is a side-effect of doing things like driving, walking the dog, and commuting to work. Basically, all these tasks should meet all these or one of these criteria:</p><h3 id="●-No-need-to-use-your-brain"><a href="#●-No-need-to-use-your-brain" class="headerlink" title="● No need to use your brain"></a>● No need to use your brain</h3><p>Tasks like commuting, taking a bath, or doing dishes are subconscious. Yes, you can make them mindful and also make their meditative process. But if you are still bored, it is best to fill these little moments of your day with information-rich podcasts. Any mindless task is an opportunity. You do not need to devote any attention to these tasks and can listen to podcasts during this time.</p><h3 id="●-Thing-is-able-to-do-independently"><a href="#●-Thing-is-able-to-do-independently" class="headerlink" title="● Thing is able to do independently"></a>● Thing is able to do independently</h3><p>Collaborative work involves communicating with others. So, it is usually best to listen to the podcast when doing something independently. But this does not mean you should always listen to the podcast when doing independent work only. Even if you are surrounded by others and working on something independently, then you can fill the time with the podcast.</p><p>Moreover, some things like when you are driving with someone or you are on a road trip, and the other person also enjoys listening to the podcast, then you can fill the time with podcast episodes that interest you both. This also allows you to talk about the episodes and the ideas discussed there, and you both will have something to talk about.</p><h3 id="●-Repetitive"><a href="#●-Repetitive" class="headerlink" title="● Repetitive"></a>● Repetitive</h3><p>You can tune in to the podcasts for repetitive tasks like doing the dishes, gardening, etc. The idea is to complement the repetitive task with something useful.</p><h2 id="15-Things-To-Do-While-Listening-To-Podcasts"><a href="#15-Things-To-Do-While-Listening-To-Podcasts" class="headerlink" title="15 Things To Do While Listening To Podcasts"></a>15 Things To Do While Listening To Podcasts</h2><p>That said, here’s a short list of things to do while listening to a podcast. It is important to note that not all of you might be doing these tasks, but you must be doing something along these lines. So, it is all about familiarizing you with mindless tasks and how you can make the most of that activity by complementing it with a podcast episode.</p><h3 id="1-Yoga-or-stretch"><a href="#1-Yoga-or-stretch" class="headerlink" title="1. Yoga or stretch"></a>1. Yoga or stretch</h3><p>As surprising as this might sound, listening to a podcast during Yoga or stretch is a great way to spice things up. Although most folks might prefer to combine yoga or gym with music, you can still listen to an information-packed yoga Podcast.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-2.jpg"                      alt="yoga podcast"                ></p><p>Besides, once you learn the stretch or yoga positions, it becomes a subconscious process. So, chances are, you might not need music to do the stretches or exercises you’ve already learned. Overall, a good yoga podcast will help improve your knowledge of the yoga field!</p><h3 id="2-Jogging"><a href="#2-Jogging" class="headerlink" title="2. Jogging"></a>2. Jogging</h3><p>Jogging appeals for its mindlessness is prominent among people. Just one foot in front of the other is all jogging and running demands. Again, most people listen to music while on a jog or run. However, you can switch from music to your favorite podcasts easily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-3.jpg"                      alt="jogging podcast"                ></p><p>Listening to podcasts is a mindful activity, so when you run or jog with a podcast episode playing in your ears, it is easy to get distracted. So, it is vital to jog or run in a safe environment while listening to podcasts.</p><h3 id="3-Fishing"><a href="#3-Fishing" class="headerlink" title="3. Fishing"></a>3. Fishing</h3><p>Many people think about an activity that involves catching fish. However, catching fish is just part of fishing. In reality, it is the moments you share with your family, see new things, and experience new challenges, and that is what fishing is all about.</p><p>If you go fishing often and listen to music or sit with your friends, you can instead listen to a podcast episode this time and create a different experience for everyone in the group.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-4.jpg"                      alt="fishing podcast"                ></p><p>Moreover, listening to a podcast while fishing does not mean you should start the podcast only when you sit near the lake or pond to fish. It is the entire process; you can start your podcast episodes right from when you take your car, the breaks you take, and while returning too. Try this one when you go fishing and dedicate all the time you set for fishing to listening to podcasts.</p><h3 id="4-Organize-your-photos-or-files"><a href="#4-Organize-your-photos-or-files" class="headerlink" title="4. Organize your photos or files"></a>4. Organize your photos or files</h3><p>If you often take time to organize your photos or files, you can combine that process with listening to your favorite podcasts. As mentioned, listening to a podcast is about concentrating on it and understanding the ideas discussed. So, you can do that with any mindless activities.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-5.jpg"                      alt="organizing podcast"                ></p><p>The benefit of combining listening to a podcast while organizing your photos or files is that you can learn new things and simplify your life by organizing your folders filled with countless images and files you always want to manage. It is to be noted that you can also listen to podcast episodes while managing your mail, scrolling through social media pages, or editing photos.</p><h3 id="5-Cook-a-meal"><a href="#5-Cook-a-meal" class="headerlink" title="5. Cook a meal"></a>5. Cook a meal</h3><p>Do you cook daily? Or maybe once or twice a week? Well, you can tune into your favorite episodes and cook. The best thing is if you are interested in cooking podcasts, then it is a perfect combination. Nevertheless, even if you follow podcasts discussing astronomy or rocket science, cooking is one of the best things to do while listening to podcasts, it saves time, and you also enjoy a healthy and delicious meal.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-6.jpg"                      alt="cooking podcast"                ></p><p>Chopping vegetables or meat, the washing process, and food preparation are some activities that consume a lot of time of people, so filling this with information-rich podcasts is a good substitute for your time.</p><h3 id="6-Driving"><a href="#6-Driving" class="headerlink" title="6. Driving"></a>6. Driving</h3><p>Driving to work and from work takes a lot of time, and you often get tired of being in the car. It is best to substitute this time with your favorite podcasts daily. This way, you will be able to make the most of the time that you waste daily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-7.jpg"                      alt="drive podcast"                ></p><p>It is important to retain that information-filled podcasts often grab all your attention, so you might focus on something other than driving itself. So, ensure that you know your routes well and listen to causal podcasts you can divert from while driving on the roads. It is best to listen to podcasts with a friend or colleague, as podcasts at such times create a perfect ebb and flow throughout the drive.</p><h3 id="7-Do-laundry-or-Fold-laundry"><a href="#7-Do-laundry-or-Fold-laundry" class="headerlink" title="7. Do laundry or Fold laundry"></a>7. Do laundry or Fold laundry</h3><p>Laundry can be frustrating; it is a hurtful process that even a laundry enthusiast hates to do. It’s time-consuming, unceasing, and seems like a never-ending process you do not want to engage in.</p><p>However, podcasts are made for such times and hurtful tasks like doing laundry or folding laundry. You can grab your headphones and tune in to your favorite podcast episode, making doing laundry an information-filled session and more effective.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-8.jpg"                      alt="laundry podcast"                ></p><p>Better yet, swift to hand-laundering. Hand laundering has a bad rep, but it is one of the best ways to burn some calories. Sometimes, hand-laundering is necessary; for instance, if you have to wash an expensive garment or want to avoid going to the laundromat, combine the entire process with your favorite podcast playing in your ears.</p><h3 id="8-Gardening"><a href="#8-Gardening" class="headerlink" title="8. Gardening"></a>8. Gardening</h3><p>Gardening is a set of activities that often are mindless. Additionally, this is one of those activities you often have to turn to every week to ensure your plants are growing normally. You can perfectly fill these activities by tuning a podcast and making the most of your time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-9.jpg"                      alt="gardening podcast"                ></p><p>Basically, if you are thinking about all the stuff to do while listening to podcasts, compile a list of mindless activities you regularly engage in and see if you can substitute such activities; in this case, gardening with podcasts should feel comfortable to you.</p><p>For instance, if you cannot focus on both, then it is best not to chase two rabbits simultaneously. The process only works if you can combine both tasks without compromising on one.</p><h3 id="9-Walk-the-dog"><a href="#9-Walk-the-dog" class="headerlink" title="9. Walk the dog"></a>9. Walk the dog</h3><p>Walking the dog is a meditative process. It’s about appreciating the surroundings, reconnecting with nature, and bonding with our four-legged friend while roaming the city’s surroundings.</p><p>However, listening to podcasts while walking your dog can also be a new experience. Not only can you listen to your podcasts, but if you choose the right one, you will cry and laugh as you walk the dog.</p><p>Besides, podcasts are one of the most followed things by dog-loving communities. A lot of people have the habit of tuning in to their favorite podcasts while walking their dogs, and you can be one of them.</p><h3 id="10-Do-the-Dishes"><a href="#10-Do-the-Dishes" class="headerlink" title="10. Do the Dishes"></a>10. Do the Dishes</h3><p>If we have to inform this, it means you are not having fun while doing the dishes. Doing dishes is one of the chores which you should take as a challenge and make really fun. The fun could be of different types, like timing yourself or racing with someone else. In this case, you can play your favorite podcast episodes and listen to them daily while doing the dishes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-10.jpg"                      alt="dishes podcast"                ></p><p>The fun, the learning, and the sense of doing something different hits differently when you combine podcasts with doing dishes; not to forget, you made something of the time that you hate the most of your day.</p><h3 id="11-Paint-your-nails"><a href="#11-Paint-your-nails" class="headerlink" title="11. Paint your nails"></a>11. Paint your nails</h3><p>Painting nails is once again one of those processes that are initially elegant and important for girls. However, the waiting time while you are drying out the nail polish is the worst. However, doing something fun like playing your high-beat music with dancing as you’ve never danced before takes you into an astral world and allows you to experience a different side of yourself. This time, however, try playing the newest episode from your favorite podcast. And note down your experience once you complete it.</p><h3 id="12-Take-a-bath"><a href="#12-Take-a-bath" class="headerlink" title="12. Take a bath"></a>12. Take a bath</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-11.jpg"                      alt="taking a bath podcast"                ></p><p>Many people take baths for granted. It is one of the best ways to reset, relax, and recharge yourself after a tiresome day. You should always make your bathes meditative or go really far into a spiritual process.</p><p>Try this: set the right temperature of the water, add essential oils to the bathtub, light some candles, and play your favorite podcast. Believe me, soon, taking a bath while listening to a podcast will become one of the best moments of your day.</p><h3 id="13-Commute"><a href="#13-Commute" class="headerlink" title="13. Commute"></a>13. Commute</h3><p>Daily commutes occupy a large part of everyone’s day. Yes, the work from home is becoming a reality. But that reality is still far in the future. Until then, you have to commute to work, children to school, groceries, and so on. Well, you can fill these times with information-rich podcasts and learn new things.</p><p>It sounds like you might not focus and listen to the podcast like you would at home. But you’ll be amazed at how well you can adapt podcast listening while commuting in a bus or train filled with people.</p><h3 id="14-Clean-the-house"><a href="#14-Clean-the-house" class="headerlink" title="14. Clean the house"></a>14. Clean the house</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-12.jpg"                      alt="clean the house podcast"                ></p><p>Again, it all comes down to making a daunting task like cleaning the house fun and entertaining. If you truly enjoy listening to the podcast, play it on your home theatre and listen to the episodes as you clean your house.</p><p>Most people ignore these beautiful tasks of the day, thinking they will be wasting their time, and often hire a housemaid. But that’s the beauty of the modern world; you can make these tasks fun and entertaining if only complemented with the right podcasts or music.</p><h3 id="15-Haircut-or-hair-dye"><a href="#15-Haircut-or-hair-dye" class="headerlink" title="15. Haircut or hair dye"></a>15. Haircut or hair dye</h3><p>A haircut is a time that you give to your barber. It is all about sitting on the chair and letting the masters do their work. And putting on earphones for listening to music and podcast can be disastrous, as one snip and your costly earphones will be gone for good.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-13.jpg"                      alt="haircut podcast"                ></p><p>However, you can make the time of everyone sitting at the saloon beautiful by simply asking the barber to play one of the podcasts they like or you like. This will also allow you to experience new podcasts you aren’t familiar with and initiate a good conversation with your client.</p><h2 id="Summing-up"><a href="#Summing-up" class="headerlink" title="Summing up"></a>Summing up</h2><p>The above list of things to do while listening to podcasts is all about acquainting you with tedious tasks and making them beautiful.</p><p>As mentioned, you can complement a podcast episode with any boring task you have to do daily and make your time most effective and fun.</p><p>Overall, there are too many mindless things that you have to do daily; simply remember to carry your earphones and make that mindless activity into a beautiful, fun, and informative session.</p><p>Using podcasts to learn and entertain is a great idea. Multitasking is also possible, which is convenient for people with little free time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-1.jpg"                      alt="podcast live"                ></p><p>So, to make the most of your time spent listening to podcasts, here are some ideas on what you can do while listening!

BP350 is one of them with awesome music streaming facilities from USBs and CDs to any powerful wireless speakers. If you have not paid for the LG’s smart Hi-Fi audio feature till now then it is possible to utilize it as simple Blu-ray player. As per updated features, users become able to enjoy DLNA support along with throng of smarts on this platform. You will be glad to know that this system provides built-in type Wi-Fi connectivity but sadly, there is no Ethernet port type connection for wireless data transfer.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>It offers bold and lush colors.</li><li>User-friendly interface makes it the first choice of beginners.</li><li>Pin sharp outlines</li><li>Attractive Design.</li><li>Possesses very decent upscaler.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Its sound somewhere lacks weight and precision.</li><li>Smaller buttons on remote.</li><li>Netfix like applications take too much time for loading on this platform.</li><li>Does not support 3D content.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bp350-3.jpg"                                     ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TIAXSDY/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00TIAXSDY&linkId=94402d7804722c294c06fec88eedeb43" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Design-and-Features"><a href="#Design-and-Features" class="headerlink" title="Design and Features"></a>Design and Features</h2><p>The design of this LG product gives an impressive impact. The shimmery diamond effect type chassis is a true representation of the style. It consists of two solid black buttons for power control and eject option. Its disc try cover appears a bit wobbly when a disc is placed over it. Although, the webOS interface feature is not present in this LG product but a similar kind of smart platform is available. When you start BP350, a color-rich background appears on the home screen. Users can easily locate all the files over the server and they can be accessed via USB type connection. You will love the app offerings from this LG product, it is Now TV, BBC iPLayer, Netfix and Amazon Instant Video, whereas few rare ones are also present like Deezer, Spotify and Blinkbox. All apps are present on a tab that is labeled as ‘Premium’. As you hover over this tab, all the apps will pop up on the bottom so that you can access everything with ease.</p><p>Here is one more great news for BP350 buyers that LG AV remote 5 application is compatible with Android and iOS and it can be downloaded directly from stores get services like basic controller. It offers interactive user interface with highly responsive design like mobile apps. In simple words, we can say that BP350 contains everything that users need from a blu-ray player. Users can easily jump between CD tracks using numerical keys on this platform.</p><p>Many users feel disappointed to see that this Blu-ray player misses so useful output options. You will not be able to find optical digital audio, HDMI audio and coaxial audio outputs over here. However, the presence of USM port on the front side makes users eligible to watch movies directly from flash drive.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bp350-1.jpg"                                     ></p><h2 id="Performance"><a href="#Performance" class="headerlink" title="Performance"></a>Performance</h2><p>If we step ahead to talk about the performance of BP350 then, one can say that it is all in one pack, unless you are not searching for 3D.

Well, the answer is yes, and here is how they differ.</p><h3 id="Color-Grading"><a href="#Color-Grading" class="headerlink" title="Color Grading"></a>Color Grading</h3><p>Color grading photoshop refers to the final process of content creation. It involves subtle tweaks to your photos to make them more stylish. Some of your reasons may include:</p><ul><li>Adjusting contrast so that you do not hurt your viewers’ eyes.</li><li>Color balancing</li><li>White balancing</li><li>Black leveling</li><li>Luminance adjustments</li><li>Color saturation.</li><li>Saturation</li><li>Hue</li><li>Effects and so on</li></ul><p>For example, tweaking your Instagram photo with a retro color scheme is color grading. You can achieve this by using photoshop cinematic color grading.</p><h3 id="Color-Correction"><a href="#Color-Correction" class="headerlink" title="Color Correction"></a>Color Correction</h3><p>Color correction refers to the fixes you make when creating your content. It focuses on making changes relevant to your target audience. You can do this during production from the device. For example, you can adjust your camera’s exposure when shooting your stills. As such, they appear more natural and unprocessed.</p><p>Additionally, you can do this in post-production, as the first step of your color grading photoshop process.</p><p>Some of the fixes you can do for color correction include:</p><ul><li>Eliminating dark spots and red eyes.</li><li>Changing the resolution to fit specific content. For example, you can adjust your photo to a 600 X 300 resolution to put it in a blog post.</li><li>Alternatively, you can color correct photos from different cameras to maintain consistency. Typically, you do this is for related content.</li><li>Finally, the vacation photos you want to share also include your ex. You can color correct them by cropping the section that has you and them.</li></ul><p>Now that you know the difference, why should you do them for your photos?</p><p>Both processes are essential to creating quality content and vary among creators. Some of the reasons include:</p><ul><li>You want to create a unique style that will make your content instantly recognizable. For example, you will immediately recognize a Quentin Tarantino movie thanks to the emphasis on red in his action scenes. Another example is Tyler Perry. He prefers brighter than usual color schemes.</li><li>Alternatively, you use color grading and color correction to create variation in scenes. For example, you can indicate a throwback photo by making it black and white.</li><li>Additionally, color grading photoshop is an excellent way to elicit different moods. For example, a color scheme that features bright yellows, greens, or blues can indicate different excitement levels.</li><li>Furthermore, you use color correction and color grading to indicate the importance of some scene sections. For example, news briefs are usually brighter than the rest of the shot, especially when displaying important messages, such as breaking news.</li><li>Finally, you do photoshop cinematic color grading to ensure consistency in your photos. Weather is unpredictable and can cause your scenes to vary dramatically. For example, some sections of your location may not receive similar lighting. As such, you can make those sections brighter through color grading in photoshop.</li></ul><h2 id="3-Simple-Ways-to-Color-Grading-in-Photoshop"><a href="#3-Simple-Ways-to-Color-Grading-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="3 Simple Ways to Color Grading in Photoshop"></a>3 Simple Ways to Color Grading in Photoshop</h2><p>Below are 3 simple ways to color grade in Photoshop.</p><h3 id="1-Using-Photo-Filter"><a href="#1-Using-Photo-Filter" class="headerlink" title="1.

You can easily omit unnecessary parts of your image with a few simple clicks. You can also seek help from a grid to ensure that your subject is in the center of the frame. Thus, you can add a symmetrical look to your images.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/photography-editing-tips-1.jpg"                      alt="crop the image"                ></p><h3 id="2-Presets-are-your-Friends"><a href="#2-Presets-are-your-Friends" class="headerlink" title="2. Presets are your Friends"></a>2. Presets are your Friends</h3><p>When processing multiple images at once, the editing process can be tiring and bothersome. To help you out, most photography editing software comes with a range of presets and tools you can apply to your photos. If all your images need similar changes, these presets can come in handy. You can also create the perfect combination of settings yourself and apply them instantly.</p><p> Image name: photography-editing-tips-2.jpg” alt&#x3D;”manga black white effect” class&#x3D;”img-fluid” &#x2F;&gt;</p><p>Image alt: use presets for image editing</p><h3 id="3-Play-With-the-Colors"><a href="#3-Play-With-the-Colors" class="headerlink" title="3. Play With the Colors"></a>3. Play With the Colors</h3><p>If you look around closely, you can find that everything is associated with a specific color. From the lush green grass to the vibrant dreamy blue skies, everything has its shade. But upon closer inspection, you will find that it’s not just a single constituent color. The grass’s green contains shades of yellow, brown, and orange too.</p><p>If you train your eye to see these hidden colors, you can easily make your images pop. Under the right lighting, you can see the various shades underlying seemingly monochromatic things. You can play with these colors using simple color grading techniques to bring a more vibrant look to your image. Adjust the vibrancy, saturation, and tint until you get the look you want in your image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/photography-editing-tips-3.jpg"                      alt="play with the image colors"                ></p><h3 id="4-Adjust-the-Contrast"><a href="#4-Adjust-the-Contrast" class="headerlink" title="4. Adjust the Contrast"></a>4. Adjust the Contrast</h3><p>One of the main reasons your images are looking flat is low contrast. Without a clear difference between foregrounds and backgrounds, the image can seemingly lack focus. You can play with the blacks and whites to adjust the contrast in your photo. Some of the best photography editing software offers a contrast slider that can help refine your image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/photography-editing-tips-4.jpg"                      alt="adjust the image contrast"                ></p><h3 id="5-Try-Overlays"><a href="#5-Try-Overlays" class="headerlink" title="5. Try Overlays"></a>5. Try Overlays</h3><p>Layering different textures and images to your photo is a great way to create visual interest in your image. Overlays are easy and helpful tools that are present in nearly all photography editing apps. You can use these to set the mood and create your desired atmosphere in the image.</p><p>Overlays are also useful for creating double exposure effects in your image. If you want to highlight some specific part of your photo, you can do it by adding a simple overlay. You can even adjust the transparency and intensity of the overlay to reach the desired effect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/photography-editing-tips-5.jpg"                      alt="apply overlays to image"                ></p><h3 id="6-Straighten-the-Horizon"><a href="#6-Straighten-the-Horizon" class="headerlink" title="6. Straighten the Horizon"></a>6. Straighten the Horizon</h3><p>Want to create a balanced and stable look for your image? You can easily achieve that by straightening the lines in your image. Although a simple trick, it is often overlooked and can impact the overall symmetry of your image.</p><p>You can choose a baseline in your image and then adjust it to straighten the image. Setting the skew during post-processing can help you create impactful images. Usually, the horizon is used as the baseline that needs straightening. You can also choose any other line in your photo and make use of the grid to rotate your image until it is in order.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/photography-editing-tips-6.jpg"                      alt="straighten the horizon"                ></p><h3 id="7-Split-the-Tone"><a href="#7-Split-the-Tone" class="headerlink" title="7. Split the Tone"></a>7. Split the Tone</h3><p>During the photography editing process, a little split-tone can go a long way. This means you can add specific colors to the shadows and highlights of your image. You can play with these colors to make your photos fall on the warm or cold end of the spectrum. Split tone can get out of hand pretty fast, so remember to keep it subtle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/photography-editing-tips-7.jpg"                      alt="use split tone feature"                ></p><h3 id="8-Know-your-White-Balance"><a href="#8-Know-your-White-Balance" class="headerlink" title="8. Know your White Balance"></a>8. Know your White Balance</h3><p>Adjusting your image’s white balance is crucial for the photography editing process. All the light sources around you have their specific temperatures. They can thus bring a specific color temperature to the photo. Cameras are usually set at auto white balance, but you can alter that in the post-processing to satisfy your requirements.</p><p>While JPEG images can somewhat bend to a specific color temperature, RAW files offer a greater degree of flexibility. You can adjust your white balance to bring the photo towards a warmer or cooler tone. You can also create a warm&#x2F;cold contrast to bring a dramatic effect to your image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/photography-editing-tips-8.jpg"                      alt="adjust image white balance"                ></p><h3 id="9-Pay-Attention-to-Details"><a href="#9-Pay-Attention-to-Details" class="headerlink" title="9. Pay Attention to Details"></a>9. Pay Attention to Details</h3><p>Being a photographer means having to keep a close eye on the details. No matter what type of photographs you are capturing, everything from nature to headshots requires keen attention to detail. One way of doing so is to remove spots or any background clutter from your picture.</p><p>Most of the prime photography editing apps offer spot removal tools. You will often encounter images where some careful adjustments are inherent. You can remove blemishes, stains, or any other distracting element from your image. This will help bring a clean and focused look to your picture.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/photography-editing-tips-9.jpg"                      alt="remove the spots from image"                ></p><h3 id="10-Don’t-Take-It-Too-Far"><a href="#10-Don’t-Take-It-Too-Far" class="headerlink" title="10. Don’t Take It Too Far"></a>10. Don’t Take It Too Far</h3><p>It is quite easy to get carried away during photography editing. Remember not to take your editing a step too far. Try to keep the natural element of the image intact and avoid overdoing the contrast and color saturation. Heavy editing can often cause a perfectly good image to fall apart. Steer clear of unnatural editing and strong color grading.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/photography-editing-tips-10.jpg"                      alt="do natural image editing"                ></p><h2 id="Wrapping-Up"><a href="#Wrapping-Up" class="headerlink" title="Wrapping Up"></a>Wrapping Up</h2><p>The process of image editing is not always a piece of cake. It requires dedication, determination, and some sharp skills which are not easy to acquire. But with the right tips and techniques at hand, you can turn almost any picture into a cinematic masterpiece.</p><p>You can try the photography editing tips mentioned above to enhance your images effortlessly. Although seemingly ordinary, these editing tips can help make or break your photos.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/new-reimagining-mobile-photoshopping-iphone-x-insights-for-2024/"><u>[New] Reimagining Mobile Photoshopping  IPhone X Insights for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/new-backtrack-innovation-box/"><u>[New] Backtrack Innovation Box</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/demonstrating-company-culture-fit-for-2024/"><u>Demonstrating Company Culture Fit for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/creating-captivating-hdr-portraits-in-10-steps/"><u>Creating Captivating HDR Portraits in 10 Steps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-speed-kings-and-queens-of-2022/"><u>2024 Approved  Speed Kings and Queens of 2022</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-beyond-flat-canvas-elevating-text-to-new-heights/"><u>[New] In 2024, Beyond Flat Canvas  Elevating Text to New Heights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/new-understanding-the-metaverse-in-contrast-to-multiplemetaverse-explained-guide-for-2024/"><u>[New] Understanding the Metaverse in Contrast to MultipleMetaverse (Explained Guide) for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-step-by-step-techniques-for-perfect-hdr-photos-in-adobe-lightroom/"><u>2024 Approved  Step-by-Step Techniques for Perfect HDR Photos in Adobe Lightroom</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/leveraging-speech-recognition-in-googles-popular-docs-application-for-2024/"><u>Leveraging Speech Recognition in Google's Popular Docs Application for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/updated-elite-5-cameras-for-slow-motion-magic-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Elite 5 Cameras for Slow Motion Magic for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-pushing-boundaries-with-film-color-grading-these-7/"><u>[New] In 2024, Pushing Boundaries with Film Color Grading (These 7)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-exploring-new-dimensions-choose-the-best-vr-headsets-for-metaverse/"><u>2024 Approved  Exploring New Dimensions  Choose the Best VR Headsets for Metaverse</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/updated-full-dive-into-the-intricacies-of-adobe-cloud-for-secure-efficient-data-management-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Full Dive Into the Intricacies of Adobe Cloud for Secure, Efficient Data Management for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-master-your-art-on-iphone-discover-the-8-prime-drawing-tools/"><u>2024 Approved  Master Your Art on iPhone  Discover the 8 Prime Drawing Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-magix-acid-pro-review-and-alternatives/"><u>2024 Approved  Magix ACID Pro Review & Alternatives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/updated-innovative-video-enhancement-using-vce-22-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Innovative Video Enhancement Using VCE 2.2 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-ps5xbox-series-x-top-gaming-tvs-unveiled/"><u>2024 Approved  PS5/Xbox Series X  Top Gaming TVs Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-ignite-interest-a-list-of-30-video-themes/"><u>2024 Approved  Ignite Interest  A List of 30 Video Themes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-content-creation-showdown-twitch-versus-youtube-explored/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Content Creation Showdown  Twitch Versus YouTube Explored</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-unlocking-the-power-of-music-in-engaging-video-content/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Unlocking the Power of Music in Engaging Video Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-skys-dynamic-range-showcase-websites-ranked-1-10/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Sky's Dynamic Range Showcase -

The PS5 is capable of rendering 4K content up to 120fps, but a 4k monitor at 60Hz would still work fine for gaming even though most TVs support only 4K @ 120Hz. PlayStation 5 doesn’t support 1440p content, so unless you’re looking for a 1080p resolution and a higher refresh rate, you should opt for the 4k option. Monitors are generally faster than TVs when it comes to input lag. You can still use them as workstations because they have ergonomic stands and are small.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ps5-poster.png"                      alt="ps5-poster"                ></p><p>In fact, the PS5 is still relatively young, and like previous generations, the technology around it is playing catch-up and trying to harness the game-changing power of the upcoming console release. Though there is a strong pull to a big TV when it comes to PS5’s visuals, many players seem to gravitate toward gaming monitors since they provide beautiful visuals and incredibly smooth gameplay and at times are much more affordable.</p><p>As long as you have a gaming monitor, there is no need to invest in a new TV. There are no screens that do not work with the new console in this roundup. In addition, to support HDR (High Dynamic Range), the PS5 offers the ability to play games in 4K. Playing the PS5 on these screens won’t cause a noticeable lag or delay, since they’re fast and responsive. Additionally, their single video output on the PS5 can be connected through an HDMI port.</p><p>We have compiled a list of the top 5 best monitors that you can find today. The options that we will discuss today are affordable for gamers, but they offer many excellent features that every gamer wants to have. So, let’s the options in detail one by one.</p><hr><p><strong>You might be interested in:</strong></p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top Monitors For Xbox Series X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top TV Set for Both ps5 and Xbox Series X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top HDMI 2.1 monitor in 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top External Hard Drive for Your PS5 in 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><h4 id="1-Acer-Nitro-XV282K-KVbmiipruzx"><a href="#1-Acer-Nitro-XV282K-KVbmiipruzx" class="headerlink" title="1.

There’s nothing really special about this 28-inch model, but its ergonomics are quite good. With its wide viewing angles and IPS panel, this is a great choice for playing co-op games. However, while it can handle reflections well and is reasonably bright, it might still struggle to deal with glare, so it won’t be the best option in extremely bright places.</p><p>The monitor supports HDMI 2.1, making it one of the first to do so. As it provides a 144Hz maximum refresh rate, exceptional response times, and support VRR, the gaming experience is incredibly fluid and virtually tear-free. The scanning display provides an excellent color gamut, but HDR brightness is not sufficient to produce punchy, bright highlights. Moreover, it has a low contrast ratio, which makes blacks appear gray in the dark.</p><p>Aside from two HDMI 2.1 ports, there are four USB 3.0 ports, one USB-C port, and DisplayPort alternate mode, each offering 65W of power. It comes with built-in speakers and a blue light filter, which enables nighttime viewing to be more comfortable. Overall, this is a great high-refresh 4k monitor that should satisfy the majority of users.</p><h4 id="2-ASUS-CG32UQ-32-Inch-4K"><a href="#2-ASUS-CG32UQ-32-Inch-4K" class="headerlink" title="2.

In addition to the ambient lighting (Halo Sync) that provides excellent glare reduction and reduced eye strain, this ASUS monitor features ASUS’s own proprietary LED technology.</p><p>Aside from HDR, it boasts a professional color gamut of 95%, meaning images will be vibrant and blacks will be dark (in contrast to non-HDR monitors, which can look grey). With most 4K HDM 2.0 monitors, you’ll get capped at 60hz if you play on a PS5. This should make for a very pleasing visual experience in conjunction with the above.</p><h4 id="3-Philips-Gaming-436M6VBPAB"><a href="#3-Philips-Gaming-436M6VBPAB" class="headerlink" title="3.

The device offers tons of ports including USB Type C, HDMI, DisplayPort, and USB 3.0, making it one of the most versatile accessories you can get. As with the ASUS CG32UQ, the HDR makes a difference with deep blacks and the Ambiglow feature, which is pretty awesome too, gives you a nice ambiance.</p><h4 id="4-Asus-TUF-Gaming-VG289Q"><a href="#4-Asus-TUF-Gaming-VG289Q" class="headerlink" title="4.

When editing video, there is a transition between every edit or cut. The easiest audio transitions in Premiere Pro are when you switch directly from one scene to the next. This enables a seamless changeover between scenes for the editor. To tie the scenes together and make the change from one scene to the next seem seamless, it usually happens gradually. The transition that seasoned videographers utilize most often is this one.</p><p>A scene or speech transition in which the audio gradually (or abruptly) lowers in volume are known as an audio fade out. If you want to know about how to crossfade audio in premiere pro, then we’ve got you covered. It is a common sort of transition that may be used to soften a transition between two clips or to smooth out a cut. However, switching between clips without any extra special effects might sometimes seem difficult to viewers. Follow the steps below to cross fade audio in Premiere Pro.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">Constant Gain</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">Constant Power</a></li><li><a href="#part1-3">Exponential Fade</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">How to Crossfade Audio in Premiere Pro</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Alternative way to add audio transitions in videos</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Types-of-Audio-Transitions-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part-1-Types-of-Audio-Transitions-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Types of Audio Transitions in Premiere Pro"></a>Part 1. Types of Audio Transitions in Premiere Pro</h2><p>Let’s briefly take a look at the most popular audio transitions in Premiere Pro before going through the step-by-step tutorial on making an audio fade out. The audio fade is essentially a visual transition. Crossfading describes the audible transition between two audio samples on the same track. The terms “fade-in” and “fade-out” refer to the two different kinds of crossfade transitions, and Premiere Pro offers its customers three different crossfade effects: constant gain, constant power, and exponential fade. Following are some specifics:</p><h3 id="Constant-Gain"><a href="#Constant-Gain" class="headerlink" title="Constant Gain"></a>Constant Gain</h3><p>When switching between scenes, audio is constantly increased or decreased. The audio frequently sounds abrupt during this crossfade. Constant gain crossfade is a kind of audio transition where the audio is consistently increased or decreased as you switch between clips. Additionally, it lacks the exponential fade’s smoothness. Don’t ignore it however; it does have its uses. You’ll probably use this sparingly.</p><h3 id="Constant-Power"><a href="#Constant-Power" class="headerlink" title="Constant Power"></a>Constant Power</h3><p>In Premiere, the fade that dilutes the audio volume fluctuations between clips is represented by Constant Power. The second clip begins with a rapid spike and then decelerates at the conclusion of the transition. It produces a fluid, cinematic sequence that is understated yet high in quality. ideal for your next movie.</p><p>It is used to gradually reduce audio for the first clip at start, then swiftly when the transition comes to a close. It works by gradually speeding up at the conclusion of the transition before gradually reducing the audio for your initial clip. This crossfades raises audio in the second clip swiftly at initially and then more gradually at the conclusion of the transition.</p><h3 id="Exponential-Fade"><a href="#Exponential-Fade" class="headerlink" title="Exponential Fade"></a>Exponential Fade</h3><p>This crossfade operates in an exponential manner, beginning slowly before accelerating till the conclusion of the clip, giving the impression of a moving curve. An audio transition known as an exponential fade begins off slowly before gradually lowering or raising the level until it is finished. It works well for sequences with dialogue switches or for the conclusion. Without the abrupt flip, it provides a considerably shorter fade out that ends fast yet gracefully. Perfect for switching scenes with various atmospheres or for conversation.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Crossfade-Audio-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Crossfade-Audio-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Crossfade Audio in Premiere Pro"></a>Part 2. How to Crossfade Audio in Premiere Pro</h2><p>All you have to do is adhere to the instructions below to fade out your audio in Premiere.

Types of Audio Transitions in Premiere Pro"></a>Part 1. Types of Audio Transitions in Premiere Pro</h2><p>Let’s briefly take a look at the most popular audio transitions in Premiere Pro before going through the step-by-step tutorial on making an audio fade out. The audio fade is essentially a visual transition. Crossfading describes the audible transition between two audio samples on the same track. The terms “fade-in” and “fade-out” refer to the two different kinds of crossfade transitions, and Premiere Pro offers its customers three different crossfade effects: constant gain, constant power, and exponential fade. Following are some specifics:</p><h3 id="Constant-Gain-1"><a href="#Constant-Gain-1" class="headerlink" title="Constant Gain"></a>Constant Gain</h3><p>When switching between scenes, audio is constantly increased or decreased. The audio frequently sounds abrupt during this crossfade. Constant gain crossfade is a kind of audio transition where the audio is consistently increased or decreased as you switch between clips. Additionally, it lacks the exponential fade’s smoothness. Don’t ignore it however; it does have its uses. You’ll probably use this sparingly.</p><h3 id="Constant-Power-1"><a href="#Constant-Power-1" class="headerlink" title="Constant Power"></a>Constant Power</h3><p>In Premiere, the fade that dilutes the audio volume fluctuations between clips is represented by Constant Power. The second clip begins with a rapid spike and then decelerates at the conclusion of the transition. It produces a fluid, cinematic sequence that is understated yet high in quality. ideal for your next movie.</p><p>It is used to gradually reduce audio for the first clip at start, then swiftly when the transition comes to a close. It works by gradually speeding up at the conclusion of the transition before gradually reducing the audio for your initial clip. This crossfades raises audio in the second clip swiftly at initially and then more gradually at the conclusion of the transition.</p><h3 id="Exponential-Fade-1"><a href="#Exponential-Fade-1" class="headerlink" title="Exponential Fade"></a>Exponential Fade</h3><p>This crossfade operates in an exponential manner, beginning slowly before accelerating till the conclusion of the clip, giving the impression of a moving curve. An audio transition known as an exponential fade begins off slowly before gradually lowering or raising the level until it is finished. It works well for sequences with dialogue switches or for the conclusion. Without the abrupt flip, it provides a considerably shorter fade out that ends fast yet gracefully. Perfect for switching scenes with various atmospheres or for conversation.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Crossfade-Audio-in-Premiere-Pro-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Crossfade-Audio-in-Premiere-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Quick-Guide-Retrieving-Past-Reddit-Threads-Instantly"><a href="#Quick-Guide-Retrieving-Past-Reddit-Threads-Instantly" class="headerlink" title="Quick Guide: Retrieving Past Reddit Threads Instantly"></a>Quick Guide: Retrieving Past Reddit Threads Instantly</h2><p>Let’s say you saw an exciting Reddit post a few days ago. But you didn’t have time to go through it, and you bookmarked it. Now, you came back to read it and, oh no…… It has been deleted for some reason.</p><p>No need to worry. You can see deleted Reddit posts in seconds. In fact, there are several simple methods to do this.</p><p>We’ll cover the best ones below and explain how to use each one.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">Unddit</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">Reveddit</a></li><li><a href="#part1-3">Resavr</a></li><li><a href="#part1-4">The Wayback Machine</a></li><li><a href="#part1-5">Google Cache</a></li></ol><h2 id="5-Ways-to-See-Deleted-Reddit-Posts"><a href="#5-Ways-to-See-Deleted-Reddit-Posts" class="headerlink" title="5 Ways to See Deleted Reddit Posts"></a>5 Ways to See Deleted Reddit Posts</h2><h3 id="1-Unddit"><a href="#1-Unddit" class="headerlink" title="1. Unddit"></a>1. Unddit</h3><p>Unddit is a third-party tool that uses Pushshift.io. This is a database that stores comments users leave on Reddit.</p><p>The main reason Unddit is so popular and used is because of its simplicity. It is easy to use the tool and takes about 10 seconds to set it all up. Let’s go over the steps to use Unddit and reveal some deleted comments on Reddit.</p><p>Step1 First, go to <a class="link"   href="https://www.unddit.com/" >Unddit.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Step2 Click on the red “Unddit” button and drag it to your bookmark bar</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/red-unddit-button.png"                      alt="unddit button pointing to bookmark"                ></p><p>Step3 Go to the deleted Reddit post</p><p>Step4 Click on the Unddit bookmark you just saved</p><p>This will automatically lead you to a new page. There, Unddit analyses and displays all the deleted comments from that post.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/unddit-results.png"                      alt="results page on unddit tool"                ></p><p>On the downside, Reddit doesn’t work well with most Reddit posts. It’s more effective for revealing deleted comments. Additionally, it may show an error from time to time. Unfortunately, the reason isn’t always displayed, and it’s something we need to live with.</p><h3 id="2-Reveddit"><a href="#2-Reveddit" class="headerlink" title="2. Reveddit"></a>2. Reveddit</h3><p>Unlike Unddit, Reveddit will always help you find deleted Reddit posts. It’s a powerful tool and much more stable compared to so many others out there.</p><p>This tool tracks Reddit activity in real-time. For example, you can use it to track deleted posts from specific users and subreddits. You can also insert a direct link into its search bar and head straight to the deleted post.</p><p>To use Reveddit, you should follow these steps:</p><p>Step1 Go to Reveddit.com</p><p>Step2 Type in a specific username, subreddit name, or simply insert the link of the deleted post</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/reveddit-search.png"                      alt="search bar on reveddit tool"                ></p><p>Step3 Click “Go” and it will display every deleted Reddit post within that search query</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/reveddit-results.png"                      alt="reveddit results page"                ></p><p>There’s one thing you need to remember about Reveddit. While it quickly shows deleted posts on Reddit, this only applies to posts and comments that were deleted by moderators or bots. So, if a user deleted their post, Reveddit won’t display that one in the results.</p><h3 id="3-Resavr"><a href="#3-Resavr" class="headerlink" title="3. Resavr"></a>3. Resavr</h3><p>Resavr is another simple tool that instantly displays deleted comments on Reddit.</p><p>It’s pretty similar to the other tools, except it only reveals comments, not Reddit posts. However, Resavr can display comments much longer than 650 words, while some tools can’t do this.</p><p>Here’s how to use this simple tool. It only takes a few seconds:</p><p>Step1 Go to Resavr.com</p><p>Step2 Type in a keyword in the top-right corner search bar</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/resavr-search-bar.png"                      alt="resavr home page"                ></p><p>Step3 It will display a list of Google results with Reddit posts that have deleted comments</p><p>The main disadvantage of Resavr is its search feature. There’s no way to search for a specific Reddit post. Instead, you can only view recent posts with deleted comments. Or you can type in a specific word and go through all the posts that pop up to find what you’re looking for.</p><h3 id="4-The-Wayback-Machine"><a href="#4-The-Wayback-Machine" class="headerlink" title="4. The Wayback Machine"></a>4. The Wayback Machine</h3><p>The Wayback Machine is a powerful tool that stores archives of other websites’ caches. It’s a non-profit site that lets you see deleted Reddit posts and comments that have been stored in the past.</p><p>It’s a bit more complicated to use, but it offers fantastic results. So, here’s what you need to do:</p><p>Step1 Visit archive.org. (Wayback Machine’s official website)</p><p>Step2 Paste the link to the deleted post and hit “Enter”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/wayback-machine-search-bar.png"                      alt="wayback machine search bar"                ></p><p>Step3 Wayback Machine will display the results in a calendar format. Click on a date to see all deleted posts on that day in history.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/wayback-machine-search-results.png"                      alt="result page on wayback machine website"                ></p><p>Wayback Machine is a little slower when loading the results than other tools. But it gives you a comprehensive list of all the deleted content highlighted when it loads.</p><p>There is another downside. This tool doesn’t archive everything instantly. So, there is a chance that some posts won’t pop up if a Reddit moderator deleted the post before Wayback Machine could archive it.</p><h3 id="5-Google-Cache"><a href="#5-Google-Cache" class="headerlink" title="5. Google Cache"></a>5. Google Cache</h3><p>Last but not least, it’s the Google Cache method. This isn’t so much a tool as it is a way to reveal deleted Reddit posts. It won’t go as far back in time as Wayback Machine to display deleted Reddit posts. It only shows recently deleted ones.</p><p>On the bright side, this method is straightforward to use. All you need to do is:</p><p>Step1 Search for the deleted Reddit post on Google</p><p>Step2 When you find the result, click on the three dots next to the page’s link</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/google-cache-method.png"                      alt="google search result three dots"                ></p><p>Step3 Then, select “Cached” from the small new window that pops up</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/google-cached-button.png"                      alt="google search result cached feature"                ></p><p>This takes you to a previous version of the page when Google bots last visited it. Hopefully, this was when the post wasn’t yet deleted. You can’t know until you see the page and check it out.</p><p>Google Cache can be either a huge win or a total failure. It depends on the post itself. If it works, it will show you everything. However, if you’re too late to the party, you won’t be able to see anything from the deleted post.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Being able to see deleted posts on Reddit can be tricky. Reddit doesn’t allow this, but it often gets overlooked, thanks to some of the tools we’ve discussed here. Even though it’s not permitted, sometimes we all want to read a post we saved a while ago.</p><p>Just remember, these tools can often stop working. This is because they don’t meet Reddit’s guidelines and run without the company’s permission. It’s not illegal or anything, but it just may crash and not display your desired results. Use them while you can and find deleted Reddit posts you want to check out.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>5 Ways to See Deleted Reddit Posts</p><h3 id="1-Unddit-1"><a href="#1-Unddit-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

This is a database that stores comments users leave on Reddit.</p><p>The main reason Unddit is so popular and used is because of its simplicity. It is easy to use the tool and takes about 10 seconds to set it all up. Let’s go over the steps to use Unddit and reveal some deleted comments on Reddit.</p><p>Step1 First, go to <a class="link"   href="https://www.unddit.com/" >Unddit.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Step2 Click on the red “Unddit” button and drag it to your bookmark bar</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/red-unddit-button.png"                      alt="unddit button pointing to bookmark"                ></p><p>Step3 Go to the deleted Reddit post</p><p>Step4 Click on the Unddit bookmark you just saved</p><p>This will automatically lead you to a new page. There, Unddit analyses and displays all the deleted comments from that post.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/unddit-results.png"                      alt="results page on unddit tool"                ></p><p>On the downside, Reddit doesn’t work well with most Reddit posts. It’s more effective for revealing deleted comments. Additionally, it may show an error from time to time. Unfortunately, the reason isn’t always displayed, and it’s something we need to live with.</p><h3 id="2-Reveddit-1"><a href="#2-Reveddit-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Reveddit"></a>2. Reveddit</h3><p>Unlike Unddit, Reveddit will always help you find deleted Reddit posts. It’s a powerful tool and much more stable compared to so many others out there.</p><p>This tool tracks Reddit activity in real-time. For example, you can use it to track deleted posts from specific users and subreddits. You can also insert a direct link into its search bar and head straight to the deleted post.</p><p>To use Reveddit, you should follow these steps:</p><p>Step1 Go to Reveddit.com</p><p>Step2 Type in a specific username, subreddit name, or simply insert the link of the deleted post</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/reveddit-search.png"                      alt="search bar on reveddit tool"                ></p><p>Step3 Click “Go” and it will display every deleted Reddit post within that search query</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/reveddit-results.png"                      alt="reveddit results page"                ></p><p>There’s one thing you need to remember about Reveddit. While it quickly shows deleted posts on Reddit, this only applies to posts and comments that were deleted by moderators or bots. So, if a user deleted their post, Reveddit won’t display that one in the results.</p><h3 id="3-Resavr-1"><a href="#3-Resavr-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Resavr"></a>3. Resavr</h3><p>Resavr is another simple tool that instantly displays deleted comments on Reddit.</p><p>It’s pretty similar to the other tools, except it only reveals comments, not Reddit posts. However, Resavr can display comments much longer than 650 words, while some tools can’t do this.</p><p>Here’s how to use this simple tool. It only takes a few seconds:</p><p>Step1 Go to Resavr.com</p><p>Step2 Type in a keyword in the top-right corner search bar</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/resavr-search-bar.png"                      alt="resavr home page"                ></p><p>Step3 It will display a list of Google results with Reddit posts that have deleted comments</p><p>The main disadvantage of Resavr is its search feature. There’s no way to search for a specific Reddit post. Instead, you can only view recent posts with deleted comments. Or you can type in a specific word and go through all the posts that pop up to find what you’re looking for.</p><h3 id="4-The-Wayback-Machine-1"><a href="#4-The-Wayback-Machine-1" class="headerlink" title="4. The Wayback Machine"></a>4. The Wayback Machine</h3><p>The Wayback Machine is a powerful tool that stores archives of other websites’ caches. It’s a non-profit site that lets you see deleted Reddit posts and comments that have been stored in the past.</p><p>It’s a bit more complicated to use, but it offers fantastic results. So, here’s what you need to do:</p><p>Step1 Visit archive.org. (Wayback Machine’s official website)</p><p>Step2 Paste the link to the deleted post and hit “Enter”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/wayback-machine-search-bar.png"                      alt="wayback machine search bar"                ></p><p>Step3 Wayback Machine will display the results in a calendar format. Click on a date to see all deleted posts on that day in history.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/wayback-machine-search-results.png"                      alt="result page on wayback machine website"                ></p><p>Wayback Machine is a little slower when loading the results than other tools. But it gives you a comprehensive list of all the deleted content highlighted when it loads.</p><p>There is another downside. This tool doesn’t archive everything instantly. So, there is a chance that some posts won’t pop up if a Reddit moderator deleted the post before Wayback Machine could archive it.</p><h3 id="5-Google-Cache-1"><a href="#5-Google-Cache-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Google Cache"></a>5. Google Cache</h3><p>Last but not least, it’s the Google Cache method. This isn’t so much a tool as it is a way to reveal deleted Reddit posts. It won’t go as far back in time as Wayback Machine to display deleted Reddit posts. It only shows recently deleted ones.</p><p>On the bright side, this method is straightforward to use. All you need to do is:</p><p>Step1 Search for the deleted Reddit post on Google</p><p>Step2 When you find the result, click on the three dots next to the page’s link</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/google-cache-method.png"                      alt="google search result three dots"                ></p><p>Step3 Then, select “Cached” from the small new window that pops up</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/google-cached-button.png"                      alt="google search result cached feature"                ></p><p>This takes you to a previous version of the page when Google bots last visited it. Hopefully, this was when the post wasn’t yet deleted. You can’t know until you see the page and check it out.</p><p>Google Cache can be either a huge win or a total failure. It depends on the post itself. If it works, it will show you everything. However, if you’re too late to the party, you won’t be able to see anything from the deleted post.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Being able to see deleted posts on Reddit can be tricky. Reddit doesn’t allow this, but it often gets overlooked, thanks to some of the tools we’ve discussed here. Even though it’s not permitted, sometimes we all want to read a post we saved a while ago.</p><p>Just remember, these tools can often stop working. This is because they don’t meet Reddit’s guidelines and run without the company’s permission. It’s not illegal or anything, but it just may crash and not display your desired results. Use them while you can and find deleted Reddit posts you want to check out.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i

So, let’s discuss the steps on how to fade audio in FL:</p><p>Step1 The first and foremost task to do is the successful installation of FL Studio. Getting the latest version of this will be useful for you as it has a lot of new features.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/open-fl-studio.jpg"                      alt="open fl studio"                ></p><p>Step2 Open your FL Studio window on your pc or mac. Then, choose the right volume parameter for the creation of automation in your FL studio. You can do it using the mixer channel method.</p><p>Step3 After getting the volume parameter, now you will need to create automation. For this, you will have to click right in the volume layer and then tap on ‘Create Automation Clip’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-automation-clips-fl-studio.jpg"                      alt="create automation clips fl studio"                ></p><p>After selecting that, there will be an addition of a new automation clip to the playlist.</p><p>Step4 Due to the automation clip, you will be able to do a smooth transition in and out of that song or audio. Now, you can create a suitable volume for fading your sound. If you want to create another new automation, then click on the right. After that click on the left and drag it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-FL-Studio-Alternative-to-Fade-Audio"><a href="#Part-2-FL-Studio-Alternative-to-Fade-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. FL Studio Alternative to Fade Audio"></a>Part 2. FL Studio Alternative to Fade Audio</h2><p>If you have the latest version of FL i.e., FL Studio 20, then it will allow you for multiple recordings. For this, you just have to build a looped region and then tap on ‘Record’. Now it will create new tracks of its own when it reaches the end region of the loop.</p><p>However, if you are looking forward to the alternative option for FL Studio, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can be a perfect substitute for this. As Filmora has a lot of features that are easy to use and has multiple editing tips, Wondershare Filmora is the best option for audio editors. Moving ahead, we will now learn how to fade in and fade out in Filmora:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>Step1 The first thing you have to do is successfully install the Filmora software on your pc or mac. Before fading audio, you should have some basic knowledge about the keyframes. After creating the audio keyframes, you will see an audio panel like the below surface.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/adjust-video-1.png"                      alt="install filmora software"                ></p><p>Step2 To fade audio in, you have to go to the audio setting. Then drag the pointer to the fade-in option which is present on the right and then apply the duration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/add-audio-fade-in-fade-out.jpg"                      alt="fade audio in"                ></p><p>Step3 If you want your audio to fade out, again go to the audio setting. Then drag the pointer to the fade-out option. Now set your duration and see the fade-out effect.</p><p>No matter which audio editing software, what matters is the learning outcome.

However, at present, the dimensions and contrast ratio of images have been common considerations.</p><p>Continue reading to learn more about the <strong>difference between SDR and HDR,</strong> if you are seriously considering upgrading to it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/sdr-vs-hdr-1.jpg"                      alt="sdr-vs-hdr"                ></p><h2 id="What-are-the-High-Dynamic-Range-HDR-and-Standard-Dynamic-Range-SDR"><a href="#What-are-the-High-Dynamic-Range-HDR-and-Standard-Dynamic-Range-SDR" class="headerlink" title="What are the High-Dynamic Range (HDR) and Standard-Dynamic Range (SDR)?"></a>What are the High-Dynamic Range (HDR) and Standard-Dynamic Range (SDR)?</h2><p>Let us discuss what SDR and HDR are in general before delving into what makes them different.</p><p>SDR, to start, stands for Standard Dynamic Range and is the basic camera and video display standard at this time. It incorporates a conventional version of the gamma curve signal to showcase videos and images. The conventional gamma curve guarantees more luminance, ranging at 100 cd&#x2F;m2 based on cathode ray tube or CRT limits that it focuses on.</p><p>On the other hand, HDR or High Dynamic Range is an advanced feature level for photography. While <strong>SDR TV meaning</strong> is common to see, HDR is available for TVs, smartphones, monitors, and different digital equipment types for better visual clarity.

Before discussing their differences in detail and showing why HDR is a better successor to <strong>SDR display,</strong> here are the overall findings in tabular form.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>HDR</strong></th><th><strong>SDR</strong></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Main Enhancement Quality</strong></td><td>HDR photography and TV effects guarantee better color, exposure, and detailed benefits. It offers a dynamic range effect in color vibrancy, cohesively enhancing the dark and light parts.</td><td>SDR does not offer a very high dynamic range and holds a limited color gamut and range. The underexposure contrast and brightness levels are slightly more muted.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Brightness</strong></td><td>The brightness can adjust between 1 nit to 1000 nits on scenes.</td><td>The brightness level for SDR devices ranges between 100-300 bits.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Color Depth</strong></td><td>HDR allows color depth support for 8-bit&#x2F;10-bit&#x2F;12-bit variety.</td><td><strong>10-bit SDR</strong> is available, but the most common standard is the 8-bit version.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Color Gamut</strong></td><td>HDR supports a color gamut of Rec.2020 and adopts the P3 version mostly.</td><td>It works with the Rec.709 type of color gamut range.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Size Availability</strong></td><td>It works with bigger-sized files and offers more exposure&#x2F;color detailing for realistic quality images.</td><td>It does not require a huge storage size since it does not process very complex data.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Internet Speed Support</strong></td><td>It requires very fast connectivity to work properly.</td><td>Works with slow-medium internet speed well.</td></tr></tbody></table><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/sdr-vs-hdr-2.jpg"                      alt="sdr-vs-hdr"                ></p><p>While these are notable points of difference, let us discuss the <strong>difference between HDR and SDR</strong> in terms of color resolution and quality for further detailing.</p><h3 id="Color-and-Contrast"><a href="#Color-and-Contrast" class="headerlink" title="Color and Contrast"></a>Color and Contrast</h3><p>Televisions and monitors with a wide color gamut support display various colors. Therefore, compared to standard-level ones, these devices support more saturation, which is more compatible with <strong>HDR&#x2F;SDR</strong>. Therefore, when it comes to visual impact, HDR is a better contender.</p><ul><li><strong>Color gamut</strong></li></ul><p>Most older monitors that supported SDR worked with a limited color gamut, even the ones that are active currently. To note, ‘color gamut’ indicates the saturation level of televisions.</p><p>The difference in terms of color gamut is visible in reds and greens. Mostly, however, this does not relate mainly to HDR. Many low-end HDR types also support a smaller color gamut, so the color depth difference is mostly visible in HDR or <strong>SDR TV</strong> with wider color gamut support.</p><ul><li><strong>Color depth</strong></li></ul><p>Similarly, the type of TV or monitor you use is important for color depth consideration. The type of <strong>SDR, meaning tv-related,</strong> that supports a wide palette of colors would have more chances to display color vibrancy for objects on TV, like the clear red gradients in apples.</p><p>An 8-bit television will support 256 shades of blue, green, and red, i.e., 16.7 million color variations. Comparatively, 10-bit TVs support 1.07 billion colors since they come with 1024 shades. <strong>SDR monitor</strong> types are typically available in 8-bit types, so the images on the screen have lower color depth. Thus, the color gradients look uneven, and images appear blocky.</p><p>In comparison, most devices that support HDR are 8-bit, 10-bit, or 12-bit TVs. They show clearer images with vibrant color variations and more gradients.</p><p>Naturally, if you want an impactful image&#x2F;video quality, HDR is a superior choice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/sdr-vs-hdr-2.jpg"                      alt="sdr-vs-hdr"                ></p><h3 id="Compatibility"><a href="#Compatibility" class="headerlink" title="Compatibility"></a>Compatibility</h3><p>It is important to consider which types of devices or setups work with these dynamic range variations, especially for HDR and <strong>SDR gaming.</strong></p><p>Check if the graphics card you are using supports HDR. Typically, HDR works with DisplayPort 1.3 and HDMI 2.0 ports suitably well. Thus, if you see any of these ports in the GPU you use, it can safely showcase HDR content. For example, the Nvidia 9xx series GPU types and its subsequent versions come with HDMI 2.0 ports. AMD graphics cards starting from the 2016 version, also support these ports.</p><p>Display compatibility is also important to consider for understanding which monitors can display HDR content. While there are <strong>1080p SDR displays,</strong> this resolution is a relatively lower support choice for HDR-compatible displays. For better results, choose 4K-supported monitors, especially those that can display HDR10 content.</p><h3 id="Encoded-formats"><a href="#Encoded-formats" class="headerlink" title="Encoded formats"></a>Encoded formats</h3><p>In terms of photography-based differences for SDR vs. HDR, you must also understand the differences in encoded format support. The SDR formats must relate to Rec.709&#x2F;sRGBgamut mainly. On the other hand, HDR works with Rec.2020 version for WCG (wide color gamut).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/sdr-vs-hdr-4.jpg"                      alt="sdr-vs-hdr"                ></p><p>Additionally, consider the stops that the SDR or HDR camera shoots in for calculating dynamic range variation. This affects the gamma&#x2F;bit depth of images. HDR assures higher levels of dynamic range, handling 17.6 stops, while most SDR displays do 6 stops in terms of dynamic range.</p><h2 id="Is-photo-and-camera-phone-HDR-as-same-as-TV-HDR"><a href="#Is-photo-and-camera-phone-HDR-as-same-as-TV-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Is photo and camera phone HDR as same as TV HDR?"></a>Is photo and camera phone HDR as same as TV HDR?</h2><p>When evaluating the <strong>difference between HDR and SDR</strong>, it is important to consider what it relates to phone-based photography or television.

These expensive cameras serve users for dangerous applications with ease as they are designed with rugged, durable, portable and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >waterproof design <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

As you cannot operate these cameras without their supporting system so it becomes essential to check the accessory kit price at the time of purchase. Prefer to buy a camera that provides all basic accessories with the box.</li><li><strong>Resolution:</strong> The major problem of maximum cameras is their poor resolution and picture clarity especially when they are mounted on helmet or moving objects. Try to ensure resolution of at least 1080p or prefer to find one with 4K quality.</li><li><strong>Memory Capacity:</strong> Few latest models never allows users to insert <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >memory card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for storage, you have to compromise with the limited internal storage only. Be aware while buying such cameras, it is necessary to have at least 32 GB storage space for better results.</li><li><strong>Battery:</strong> A camera unit with non removable battery is of no use because it cannot assist you in long tours. One must get a device with removable and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >rechargeable batteries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> so that it can serve you beyond any time limit.</li></ul><h2 id="Top-10-Cheap-Budget-Friendly-Action-Cameras-1"><a href="#Top-10-Cheap-Budget-Friendly-Action-Cameras-1" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Cheap&#x2F;Budget Friendly Action Cameras"></a>Top 10 Cheap&#x2F;Budget Friendly Action Cameras</h2><h4 id="1-Xiaomi-Yi-Action-Camera-79-99-https-www-amazon-com-gp-product-B01C89GCHU-ref-as-5Fli-5Ftl-ie-UTF8-tag-vs-flora-20-camp-1789-creative-9325-linkCode-as2-creativeASIN-B01C89GCHU-linkId-0fa33bbe15256887fcfa7957bd8e3a3a"><a href="#1-Xiaomi-Yi-Action-Camera-79-99-https-www-amazon-com-gp-product-B01C89GCHU-ref-as-5Fli-5Ftl-ie-UTF8-tag-vs-flora-20-camp-1789-creative-9325-linkCode-as2-creativeASIN-B01C89GCHU-linkId-0fa33bbe15256887fcfa7957bd8e3a3a" class="headerlink" title="1.

It was first invented in the 1970s by Garrett Brown. He used his background as a Hollywood director of photography with experience in major motion pictures to create the device for film production purposes. Steadicams are typically suspended from the operator’s body at chest level, known as “the shoulder mount.” The armature fits over one of the operator’s shoulders and attaches to their belt or harness around their waist while they control its movement using two handles - one for each hand.</p><p>They are generally used when shooting video in recording situations where the camera needs to move free of vibration or shake. This includes handheld, shoulder-mounted, tripod, sliders, and other stabilizing equipment.</p><p>Because of its portability, a Steadicam allows directors to shoot in locations that might otherwise not have been suitable for conventional complex camera setups. It also enables cinematographers to create moving shots, which are difficult or impossible without one. A Steadicam can also be used to “fly” through scenes by attaching the camera to a crane or dolly while allowing the operator to walk free if desired.</p><p>The Steadicam is handy in film production because it allows for stable footage even when utilizing very long lenses and uneven terrain. This means that if you are working on a budget, you can avoid spending money on equipment rentals that may not fit your schedule or needs. Steadicams have become an essential filming tool because of how flexible they are in any situation - there’s no longer a need for specialized equipment or setups for specific shots. They are vital tools that allow you greater creative freedom with many types of images, all while achieving excellent quality footage.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-types-of-Steadicams-are-there"><a href="#Part-2-What-types-of-Steadicams-are-there" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What types of Steadicams are there?"></a>Part 2: What types of Steadicams are there?</h2><p>Three types of Steadicams are currently on the market.</p><p><strong>The Classic Steadicam:</strong> This is the original design by Garrett Brown and is still in use today. It has a two-point support system, which gives it more stability but decreases mobility slightly.</p><p><strong>The Merlin:</strong> This was designed as a more portable version of the classic Steadicam and used a three-point support system for better stability.</p><p><strong>The Ultra:</strong> This is the most recent addition to Steadicams and has a two-point support system, which makes it easy to set up and use quickly but decreases stability slightly.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Best-Steadicams-for-DSRL-Filming"><a href="#Part-3-Best-Steadicams-for-DSRL-Filming" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Best Steadicams for DSRL Filming"></a>Part 3: Best Steadicams for DSRL Filming</h2><h3 id="1-Zhiyun-Crane-M-3-Axis-Steadicam-with-gimbal"><a href="#1-Zhiyun-Crane-M-3-Axis-Steadicam-with-gimbal" class="headerlink" title="1.

Its simplicity help in being very easy to work with, and it even comes with a phone holder for smooth shots.</p><p><strong>Features</strong></p><p>The base is already pretty big, so there isn’t much room for expansion, but it is still possible to attach larger counterweight plates on top of these small ones. All directions are easily controlled with the 5-way joystick.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Very easy to use &amp; set up</li><li>It comes with a phone holder for smooth shots</li><li>It doesn’t take up much space on the go</li><li>Affordable price point</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>There is no panning or tilting control on the base unit - only available at the top.</li></ul><p><strong>Should you buy it?</strong></p><p>If ease of use is your biggest concern, then the Zhiyun Crane-M will be right up your alley.</p><h3 id="2-Glidecam-XR-PRO-Steadicam-DSLR"><a href="#2-Glidecam-XR-PRO-Steadicam-DSLR" class="headerlink" title="2.

It was first invented in the 1970s by Garrett Brown. He used his background as a Hollywood director of photography with experience in major motion pictures to create the device for film production purposes. Steadicams are typically suspended from the operator’s body at chest level, known as “the shoulder mount.” The armature fits over one of the operator’s shoulders and attaches to their belt or harness around their waist while they control its movement using two handles - one for each hand.</p><p>They are generally used when shooting video in recording situations where the camera needs to move free of vibration or shake. This includes handheld, shoulder-mounted, tripod, sliders, and other stabilizing equipment.</p><p>Because of its portability, a Steadicam allows directors to shoot in locations that might otherwise not have been suitable for conventional complex camera setups. It also enables cinematographers to create moving shots, which are difficult or impossible without one. A Steadicam can also be used to “fly” through scenes by attaching the camera to a crane or dolly while allowing the operator to walk free if desired.</p><p>The Steadicam is handy in film production because it allows for stable footage even when utilizing very long lenses and uneven terrain. This means that if you are working on a budget, you can avoid spending money on equipment rentals that may not fit your schedule or needs. Steadicams have become an essential filming tool because of how flexible they are in any situation - there’s no longer a need for specialized equipment or setups for specific shots. They are vital tools that allow you greater creative freedom with many types of images, all while achieving excellent quality footage.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-types-of-Steadicams-are-there-1"><a href="#Part-2-What-types-of-Steadicams-are-there-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What types of Steadicams are there?"></a>Part 2: What types of Steadicams are there?</h2><p>Three types of Steadicams are currently on the market.</p><p><strong>The Classic Steadicam:</strong> This is the original design by Garrett Brown and is still in use today.

It was first invented in the 1970s by Garrett Brown. He used his background as a Hollywood director of photography with experience in major motion pictures to create the device for film production purposes. Steadicams are typically suspended from the operator’s body at chest level, known as “the shoulder mount.” The armature fits over one of the operator’s shoulders and attaches to their belt or harness around their waist while they control its movement using two handles - one for each hand.</p><p>They are generally used when shooting video in recording situations where the camera needs to move free of vibration or shake. This includes handheld, shoulder-mounted, tripod, sliders, and other stabilizing equipment.</p><p>Because of its portability, a Steadicam allows directors to shoot in locations that might otherwise not have been suitable for conventional complex camera setups. It also enables cinematographers to create moving shots, which are difficult or impossible without one. A Steadicam can also be used to “fly” through scenes by attaching the camera to a crane or dolly while allowing the operator to walk free if desired.</p><p>The Steadicam is handy in film production because it allows for stable footage even when utilizing very long lenses and uneven terrain. This means that if you are working on a budget, you can avoid spending money on equipment rentals that may not fit your schedule or needs. Steadicams have become an essential filming tool because of how flexible they are in any situation - there’s no longer a need for specialized equipment or setups for specific shots. They are vital tools that allow you greater creative freedom with many types of images, all while achieving excellent quality footage.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-types-of-Steadicams-are-there-3"><a href="#Part-2-What-types-of-Steadicams-are-there-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What types of Steadicams are there?"></a>Part 2: What types of Steadicams are there?</h2><p>Three types of Steadicams are currently on the market.</p><p><strong>The Classic Steadicam:</strong> This is the original design by Garrett Brown and is still in use today. It has a two-point support system, which gives it more stability but decreases mobility slightly.</p><p><strong>The Merlin:</strong> This was designed as a more portable version of the classic Steadicam and used a three-point support system for better stability.</p><p><strong>The Ultra:</strong> This is the most recent addition to Steadicams and has a two-point support system, which makes it easy to set up and use quickly but decreases stability slightly.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Best-Steadicams-for-DSRL-Filming-3"><a href="#Part-3-Best-Steadicams-for-DSRL-Filming-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Best Steadicams for DSRL Filming"></a>Part 3: Best Steadicams for DSRL Filming</h2><h3 id="1-Zhiyun-Crane-M-3-Axis-Steadicam-with-gimbal-3"><a href="#1-Zhiyun-Crane-M-3-Axis-Steadicam-with-gimbal-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

Next, adjust the arm’s length so that it is in line with your shoulder. Tighten the knob on top of the arm to secure it in place.</p><p>Next, fit the vest around your waist and tighten both straps evenly. Now you can attach the sled to your vest. You should be able to feel a little weight on your shoulders and chest, but not too much.</p><p>Finally, connect the arm and vest with all its links (the black bars). Tighten each link one by one until they are snug against each other.</p><p>That’s how easy it is to set up a Steadicam!!</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Stabilize-Video-Without-a-Steadicam-After-Recording-3"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Stabilize-Video-Without-a-Steadicam-After-Recording-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Stabilize Video Without a Steadicam After Recording?"></a>Part 5: How to Stabilize Video Without a Steadicam After Recording?</h2><p>If you have recorded the video already and found the footage is shaky, you may need a post-production software to remove the shaky and stabilize the video.</p><p>Wondershare Filmora video editor allows you to stabilize the shaky video automatically with a few clicks.
