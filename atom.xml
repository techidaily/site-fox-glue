It makes the content editing process a hassle-free, creative, and enjoyable activity. Also, beginners and amateur content editors can easily use Affinity Photo.</p><p>No matter you are a professional content creator or a newbie, we’ll be discussing how to remove background in Affinity Photo. Let’s explore how to use the good editing tool to be free of the stressful editing process.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="How-to-Remove-Affinity-Photo-to-Remove-Image’s-Background"><a href="#How-to-Remove-Affinity-Photo-to-Remove-Image’s-Background" class="headerlink" title="How to Remove Affinity Photo to Remove Image’s Background"></a>How to Remove Affinity Photo to Remove Image’s Background</h2><p>Affinity Photo is a simple and easy-to-use editing software, and you can remove a background in it under two scenarios: remove a white or a busy background.</p><h3 id="How-to-Erase-a-White-Background-in-Affinity-Designer"><a href="#How-to-Erase-a-White-Background-in-Affinity-Designer" class="headerlink" title="How to Erase a White Background in Affinity Designer"></a>How to Erase a White Background in Affinity Designer</h3><p>To erase a white background in Affinity Designer, do these steps:</p><p>Step1 In the first step, install the <a class="link"   href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/" >Affinity Designer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>software and launch it on your computer. Go to <strong>“File” &gt; “Open”</strong> and head to the location of your image with a white background on your drive to import it.</p><p>Now access the <strong>Pixel Persona</strong> section in the left corner of the software screen by clicking the <strong>colored boxes</strong> icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/accessing-the-pixel-persona-in-affinity-designer.png"                      alt="accessing the pixel persona in affinity designer"                ></p><p>Step2 Go to the <strong>“Layers”</strong> tab in the right pane, right-click your layer, and disable <strong>“Lock.”</strong> Now right-click on your layer again, and select <strong>“Rasterize”</strong> to enable editing of specific parts of the image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/unlocking-the-image-layer-in-affinity-designer.png"                      alt="unlocking the image layer in affinity designer"                ></p><p>Step3 To make a selection around your subject, first enable the <strong>“Snap To Edges”</strong> and <strong>“Soft Edges”</strong> feature from the top toolbar. This will help you automatically detect the edges and give it a more tapered finish.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/enabling-snap-to-edges-and-soft-edges-in-affinity-designer.png"                      alt="enabling snap to edges and soft edges in affinity designer"                ></p><p>Set your brush size using your keyboard’s <strong>left</strong> and <strong>right bracket</strong> keys. Now, manually make a selection around your subject and white edges in the image as precisely as possible.</p><p>Step4 Next, zoom in on your subject. Press &amp; hold the ALT key on your keyboard, and use the Selection Brush tool to manually correct the rough edges of your outline.</p><p>Click the <strong>“Refine”</strong> option in the toolbar to open the <strong>“Refine Selection”</strong> menu. A red mask will be applied to your subject, giving you an idea of how your image will look once you remove the background. Zoom in and if any details are excluded, paint them over. Once you are satisfied, click <strong>“Apply”</strong> to save your changes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/refining-the-outline-around-the-image-to-remove-background-in-affinity-designer.png"                      alt="refining the outline around the image to remove background in affinity designer"                ></p><p>Step5 In the last step, press the <strong>“Delete”</strong> key on your keyboard to remove the background, or click <strong>“Edit”</strong> and choose the <strong>“Cut”</strong> option.</p><p>Now, hit <strong>“Control+D”</strong> to deselect the selection. Alternatively, you can click <strong>“Select”</strong> in the top toolbar and choose the <strong>“Deselect”</strong> option. Finally, you can export your file using the <strong>“File” &gt; “Export”</strong> option.</p><h3 id="How-to-Remove-a-Busy-Background-in-Affinity-Designer"><a href="#How-to-Remove-a-Busy-Background-in-Affinity-Designer" class="headerlink" title="How to Remove a Busy Background in Affinity Designer"></a>How to Remove a Busy Background in Affinity Designer</h3><p>If you want to remove a busy background of an image in the Affinity Designer software, follow these steps carefully:</p><p>Step1 Click the <strong>“File”</strong> option in Affinity Designer and select <strong>“Open”</strong> from the drop-down menu. Select your image and click <strong>“Open”</strong> to import your picture.</p><p>From the right-side panel, open the <strong>Layers</strong> tab and click the <strong>“Lock”</strong> icon to unlock your image layer, which is set as locked by default. Now, right-click on the layer and select <strong>“Rasterize &amp; Trim.”</strong> Rasterization will help remove the background.</p><p>Step2 Next, you have to make a selection around your object&#x2F;subject in the picture. Click the <strong>“Selection Brush”</strong> tool from the left-side panel to do so.</p><p>Now your cursor will be changed to a circle. To increase or decrease the brush size, use the <strong>Right</strong> and <strong>Left Bracket</strong> keys on your keyboard. Now, move around the brush on your image to outline your subject.</p><p>Step3 Once you’ve made a selection around your object, it’s time to refine it to make it more precise. To do so, click the <strong>“Refine”</strong> option from the top toolbar to open the <strong>“Refine Selection”</strong> menu.</p><p>Focus on the <strong>Foreground</strong> and <strong>Background</strong> brushes in the <strong>Refine Selection</strong> menu and toggle between these settings to make your selection more accurate. You can use the <strong>Right or Left Bracket</strong> key on your keyboard to adjust the brush size where needed.<br>Once satisfied with your changes, click the <strong>“Apply”</strong> option in the <strong>Refine Selection</strong> menu to save your settings.</p><p>Step4 Now that you’ve outlined your subject clearly and precisely, it’s time to remove the busy background. To do so, click the <strong>Delete key</strong> on your keyboard if you use a Windows PC.</p><p>If you are using a Mac system, click <strong>“Edit”</strong> in the toolbar and select <strong>“Cut”</strong> from the drop-down menu. Your background will be removed and changed to a checkboard pattern.</p><p>Step5 In this last step, you must deselect the outline around your subject. For this, press the <strong>“Control+D”</strong> key on your keyboard or click <strong>“Select”</strong> in the toolbar and choose the <strong>“Deselect”</strong> option.</p><p>Finally, click <strong>“File”</strong> and select the <strong>“Export”</strong> option from the drop-down menu. Then, in the Export Settings menu, choose PNG and click <strong>“Export”</strong> to save your file on your PC.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> To save your image with a transparent background, do not export it in JPG file format.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130532/26400" target="_top" id="2130532">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130532" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130532/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-Best-Alternative-of-Affinity-Photo"><a href="#The-Best-Alternative-of-Affinity-Photo" class="headerlink" title="The Best Alternative of Affinity Photo"></a>The Best Alternative of Affinity Photo</h2><p>Since Affinity Photo is a desktop software available for a one-time purchase of $40.99, you might be looking for an online free alternative if you need more space or can afford the subscription fee.</p><p>Therefore, we recommend using <a class="link"   href="https://pixcut.wondershare.com/" >Wondershare PixCut <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, an advanced AI-based online tool developed by<a class="link"   href="https://www.wondershare.com/" >Wondershare Technology. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/wondershare-pixcut-for-removing-image-background.png"                      alt="wondershare pixcut for removing image background"                ></p><p>Editing experts recommend Wondershare PixCut as the best alternative to many editing problems.

Multitasking is also possible, which is convenient for people with little free time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-1.jpg"                      alt="podcast live"                ></p><p>So, to make the most of your time spent listening to podcasts, here are some ideas on what you can do while listening! Keep reading to find out more.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="When-Listening-to-a-Podcast-What-Is-Appropriate-To-Do"><a href="#When-Listening-to-a-Podcast-What-Is-Appropriate-To-Do" class="headerlink" title="When Listening to a Podcast, What Is Appropriate To Do?"></a>When Listening to a Podcast, What Is Appropriate To Do?</h2><p>You do not need to dedicate a specific time to listen to podcasts. The entire idea of the podcast is auto-based information and shows to entertain users while doing something tedious and tiresome.</p><p>It allows you to fill those moments by learning new things and improving cognitive skills. Plus, it is a side-effect of doing things like driving, walking the dog, and commuting to work. Basically, all these tasks should meet all these or one of these criteria:</p><h3 id="●-No-need-to-use-your-brain"><a href="#●-No-need-to-use-your-brain" class="headerlink" title="● No need to use your brain"></a>● No need to use your brain</h3><p>Tasks like commuting, taking a bath, or doing dishes are subconscious. Yes, you can make them mindful and also make their meditative process. But if you are still bored, it is best to fill these little moments of your day with information-rich podcasts. Any mindless task is an opportunity. You do not need to devote any attention to these tasks and can listen to podcasts during this time.</p><h3 id="●-Thing-is-able-to-do-independently"><a href="#●-Thing-is-able-to-do-independently" class="headerlink" title="● Thing is able to do independently"></a>● Thing is able to do independently</h3><p>Collaborative work involves communicating with others. So, it is usually best to listen to the podcast when doing something independently. But this does not mean you should always listen to the podcast when doing independent work only. Even if you are surrounded by others and working on something independently, then you can fill the time with the podcast.</p><p>Moreover, some things like when you are driving with someone or you are on a road trip, and the other person also enjoys listening to the podcast, then you can fill the time with podcast episodes that interest you both. This also allows you to talk about the episodes and the ideas discussed there, and you both will have something to talk about.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130528/26400" target="_top" id="2130528">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130528" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130528/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="●-Repetitive"><a href="#●-Repetitive" class="headerlink" title="● Repetitive"></a>● Repetitive</h3><p>You can tune in to the podcasts for repetitive tasks like doing the dishes, gardening, etc. The idea is to complement the repetitive task with something useful.</p><h2 id="15-Things-To-Do-While-Listening-To-Podcasts"><a href="#15-Things-To-Do-While-Listening-To-Podcasts" class="headerlink" title="15 Things To Do While Listening To Podcasts"></a>15 Things To Do While Listening To Podcasts</h2><p>That said, here’s a short list of things to do while listening to a podcast. It is important to note that not all of you might be doing these tasks, but you must be doing something along these lines. So, it is all about familiarizing you with mindless tasks and how you can make the most of that activity by complementing it with a podcast episode.</p><h3 id="1-Yoga-or-stretch"><a href="#1-Yoga-or-stretch" class="headerlink" title="1. Yoga or stretch"></a>1. Yoga or stretch</h3><p>As surprising as this might sound, listening to a podcast during Yoga or stretch is a great way to spice things up. Although most folks might prefer to combine yoga or gym with music, you can still listen to an information-packed yoga Podcast.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-2.jpg"                      alt="yoga podcast"                ></p><p>Besides, once you learn the stretch or yoga positions, it becomes a subconscious process. So, chances are, you might not need music to do the stretches or exercises you’ve already learned. Overall, a good yoga podcast will help improve your knowledge of the yoga field!</p><h3 id="2-Jogging"><a href="#2-Jogging" class="headerlink" title="2. Jogging"></a>2. Jogging</h3><p>Jogging appeals for its mindlessness is prominent among people. Just one foot in front of the other is all jogging and running demands. Again, most people listen to music while on a jog or run. However, you can switch from music to your favorite podcasts easily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-3.jpg"                      alt="jogging podcast"                ></p><p>Listening to podcasts is a mindful activity, so when you run or jog with a podcast episode playing in your ears, it is easy to get distracted. So, it is vital to jog or run in a safe environment while listening to podcasts.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118326/7443" target="_top" id="2118326">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118326" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118326/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Fishing"><a href="#3-Fishing" class="headerlink" title="3. Fishing"></a>3. Fishing</h3><p>Many people think about an activity that involves catching fish. However, catching fish is just part of fishing. In reality, it is the moments you share with your family, see new things, and experience new challenges, and that is what fishing is all about.</p><p>If you go fishing often and listen to music or sit with your friends, you can instead listen to a podcast episode this time and create a different experience for everyone in the group.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-4.jpg"                      alt="fishing podcast"                ></p><p>Moreover, listening to a podcast while fishing does not mean you should start the podcast only when you sit near the lake or pond to fish. It is the entire process; you can start your podcast episodes right from when you take your car, the breaks you take, and while returning too. Try this one when you go fishing and dedicate all the time you set for fishing to listening to podcasts.</p><h3 id="4-Organize-your-photos-or-files"><a href="#4-Organize-your-photos-or-files" class="headerlink" title="4. Organize your photos or files"></a>4. Organize your photos or files</h3><p>If you often take time to organize your photos or files, you can combine that process with listening to your favorite podcasts. As mentioned, listening to a podcast is about concentrating on it and understanding the ideas discussed. So, you can do that with any mindless activities.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-5.jpg"                      alt="organizing podcast"                ></p><p>The benefit of combining listening to a podcast while organizing your photos or files is that you can learn new things and simplify your life by organizing your folders filled with countless images and files you always want to manage. It is to be noted that you can also listen to podcast episodes while managing your mail, scrolling through social media pages, or editing photos.</p><h3 id="5-Cook-a-meal"><a href="#5-Cook-a-meal" class="headerlink" title="5. Cook a meal"></a>5. Cook a meal</h3><p>Do you cook daily? Or maybe once or twice a week? Well, you can tune into your favorite episodes and cook. The best thing is if you are interested in cooking podcasts, then it is a perfect combination. Nevertheless, even if you follow podcasts discussing astronomy or rocket science, cooking is one of the best things to do while listening to podcasts, it saves time, and you also enjoy a healthy and delicious meal.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-6.jpg"                      alt="cooking podcast"                ></p><p>Chopping vegetables or meat, the washing process, and food preparation are some activities that consume a lot of time of people, so filling this with information-rich podcasts is a good substitute for your time.</p><h3 id="6-Driving"><a href="#6-Driving" class="headerlink" title="6. Driving"></a>6. Driving</h3><p>Driving to work and from work takes a lot of time, and you often get tired of being in the car. It is best to substitute this time with your favorite podcasts daily. This way, you will be able to make the most of the time that you waste daily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-7.jpg"                      alt="drive podcast"                ></p><p>It is important to retain that information-filled podcasts often grab all your attention, so you might focus on something other than driving itself. So, ensure that you know your routes well and listen to causal podcasts you can divert from while driving on the roads. It is best to listen to podcasts with a friend or colleague, as podcasts at such times create a perfect ebb and flow throughout the drive.</p><h3 id="7-Do-laundry-or-Fold-laundry"><a href="#7-Do-laundry-or-Fold-laundry" class="headerlink" title="7. Do laundry or Fold laundry"></a>7. Do laundry or Fold laundry</h3><p>Laundry can be frustrating; it is a hurtful process that even a laundry enthusiast hates to do. It’s time-consuming, unceasing, and seems like a never-ending process you do not want to engage in.</p><p>However, podcasts are made for such times and hurtful tasks like doing laundry or folding laundry.

Hand laundering has a bad rep, but it is one of the best ways to burn some calories. Sometimes, hand-laundering is necessary; for instance, if you have to wash an expensive garment or want to avoid going to the laundromat, combine the entire process with your favorite podcast playing in your ears.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139111/17108" target="_top" id="2139111">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139111" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139111/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="8-Gardening"><a href="#8-Gardening" class="headerlink" title="8.

Additionally, this is one of those activities you often have to turn to every week to ensure your plants are growing normally. You can perfectly fill these activities by tuning a podcast and making the most of your time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-9.jpg"                      alt="gardening podcast"                ></p><p>Basically, if you are thinking about all the stuff to do while listening to podcasts, compile a list of mindless activities you regularly engage in and see if you can substitute such activities; in this case, gardening with podcasts should feel comfortable to you.</p><p>For instance, if you cannot focus on both, then it is best not to chase two rabbits simultaneously. The process only works if you can combine both tasks without compromising on one.</p><h3 id="9-Walk-the-dog"><a href="#9-Walk-the-dog" class="headerlink" title="9. Walk the dog"></a>9. Walk the dog</h3><p>Walking the dog is a meditative process. It’s about appreciating the surroundings, reconnecting with nature, and bonding with our four-legged friend while roaming the city’s surroundings.</p><p>However, listening to podcasts while walking your dog can also be a new experience. Not only can you listen to your podcasts, but if you choose the right one, you will cry and laugh as you walk the dog.</p><p>Besides, podcasts are one of the most followed things by dog-loving communities. A lot of people have the habit of tuning in to their favorite podcasts while walking their dogs, and you can be one of them.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137220/26400" target="_top" id="2137220">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137220" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137220/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="10-Do-the-Dishes"><a href="#10-Do-the-Dishes" class="headerlink" title="10.

Doing dishes is one of the chores which you should take as a challenge and make really fun. The fun could be of different types, like timing yourself or racing with someone else. In this case, you can play your favorite podcast episodes and listen to them daily while doing the dishes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-10.jpg"                      alt="dishes podcast"                ></p><p>The fun, the learning, and the sense of doing something different hits differently when you combine podcasts with doing dishes; not to forget, you made something of the time that you hate the most of your day.</p><h3 id="11-Paint-your-nails"><a href="#11-Paint-your-nails" class="headerlink" title="11. Paint your nails"></a>11. Paint your nails</h3><p>Painting nails is once again one of those processes that are initially elegant and important for girls. However, the waiting time while you are drying out the nail polish is the worst. However, doing something fun like playing your high-beat music with dancing as you’ve never danced before takes you into an astral world and allows you to experience a different side of yourself. This time, however, try playing the newest episode from your favorite podcast. And note down your experience once you complete it.</p><h3 id="12-Take-a-bath"><a href="#12-Take-a-bath" class="headerlink" title="12. Take a bath"></a>12.

You should always make your bathes meditative or go really far into a spiritual process.</p><p>Try this: set the right temperature of the water, add essential oils to the bathtub, light some candles, and play your favorite podcast. Believe me, soon, taking a bath while listening to a podcast will become one of the best moments of your day.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137214/26400" target="_top" id="2137214">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137214" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137214/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="13-Commute"><a href="#13-Commute" class="headerlink" title="13.

If you truly enjoy listening to the podcast, play it on your home theatre and listen to the episodes as you clean your house.</p><p>Most people ignore these beautiful tasks of the day, thinking they will be wasting their time, and often hire a housemaid. But that’s the beauty of the modern world; you can make these tasks fun and entertaining if only complemented with the right podcasts or music.</p><h3 id="15-Haircut-or-hair-dye"><a href="#15-Haircut-or-hair-dye" class="headerlink" title="15.

This will also allow you to experience new podcasts you aren’t familiar with and initiate a good conversation with your client.</p><h2 id="Summing-up"><a href="#Summing-up" class="headerlink" title="Summing up"></a>Summing up</h2><p>The above list of things to do while listening to podcasts is all about acquainting you with tedious tasks and making them beautiful.</p><p>As mentioned, you can complement a podcast episode with any boring task you have to do daily and make your time most effective and fun.</p><p>Overall, there are too many mindless things that you have to do daily; simply remember to carry your earphones and make that mindless activity into a beautiful, fun, and informative session.</p><p>Using podcasts to learn and entertain is a great idea. Multitasking is also possible, which is convenient for people with little free time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-1.jpg"                      alt="podcast live"                ></p><p>So, to make the most of your time spent listening to podcasts, here are some ideas on what you can do while listening!

Many editors add slow-motion effects to videos or parts to create a stylish and top-notch look.</p><p>However, this effect becomes a default in the videos after adding it, and users cannot easily deactivate the setting. It can get annoying to deal with when you are trying to play a video, but it starts automatically playing in slow-motion on your video player. Thus, for most users, learning <strong>how to change slow-motion video to normal-speed Android</strong> is important.</p><p>In general, there is no built-in feature that allows Android users to change recorded video speed, like reversing slow motion. So, it would be best if you considered third-party tools in this case. Multiple options are usable in this context, and we explain some of the best ones here. Interested?

There is a difference between the two. Do you wish to see a recording for a longer time on screen? The slow-motion videos do exactly the same. A video’s motion is captured at a higher framerate than the actual speed of playback. i.e. the time observation is slowed down. For instance, if you add slow-motion effect to a 2 seconds video, it appears to last longer on the screen.</p><p> Whereas, a timelapse video is a sort of fast-forward. A time span that has lasted for long but while depicting it on screen, you speed up the perception of time or the actual time is the time-lapse.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> Now, creating slow-motion videos on your Android is easy and fun with the above-mentioned apps.

In fact, according to a recent study, 92% of consumers say they heavily rely on online reviews and testimonials when making purchasing decisions. 88% of those consumers say they trust those testimonials as much as personal recommendations from their friends, family members, and colleagues. This means that if you can get your clients or customers talking about how great your products or services are on camera, it will help them make buying decisions, reinforce your brand message and build relationships with their followers and peers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/video-testimonial.jpg"                      alt="video testimonial"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Why-Video-Testimonials-Are-Important-for-Marketing"><a href="#Why-Video-Testimonials-Are-Important-for-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Why Video Testimonials Are Important for Marketing"></a>Why Video Testimonials Are Important for Marketing</h2><h3 id="Video-testimonials-help-customers-make-their-buying-decisions"><a href="#Video-testimonials-help-customers-make-their-buying-decisions" class="headerlink" title="Video testimonials help customers make their buying decisions"></a>Video testimonials help customers make their buying decisions</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/help-customers-decisions.jpg"                      alt="help customers decisions"                ></p><p>Video testimonials are an amazing way to demonstrate the value of your business. They help customers make their buying decisions, they’re more effective than written testimonials, and they are more authentic and believable than the written ones.</p><p>Video testimonials help reinforce your company’s message. When you see a product or service demonstrated in action by someone who is actually using it in real life—which is what happens when you watch a video—you can get a much better understanding of what it does for people who experience it firsthand. This can make an enormous difference when trying to convey the benefits of something like an electric toothbrush or headphones compared to just reading about them on paper or hearing about them from someone else who may not be fully knowledgeable about how awesome these products really are!</p><p>It also helps build relationships with potential clients because videos allow us to connect with people on a personal level in ways that would otherwise be impossible through text-only formats such as email messages only ever so briefly exchanged between two parties before being quickly forgotten forever when we move onto other things.</p><h3 id="Video-testimonials-help-reinforce-your-company’s-message"><a href="#Video-testimonials-help-reinforce-your-company’s-message" class="headerlink" title="Video testimonials help reinforce your company’s message"></a>Video testimonials help reinforce your company’s message</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/reinforce-company-message.jpg"                      alt="reinforce company message"                ></p><p>Video testimonials are a great way to reinforce your company’s message and make potential customers feel like they know you, your business, and your products.</p><p>When customers see another person saying good things about their service, it makes them more likely to trust and use that service themselves. Video testimonials can help you reach a larger audience by being shared on social media, review sites, and other marketing channels.</p><p>If you want to build trust with your audience, having real people talk about their experiences in using your products is a great way to do it. Video testimonials can help you get more customers by showing them that other people have had good experiences with your product and that it does what it says it does. They can also help you sell more because when someone sees someone else saying how much they love a product, they will think “hey, maybe I should try this too.”</p><h3 id="Video-testimonials-are-more-authentic-and-believable-than-written-ones"><a href="#Video-testimonials-are-more-authentic-and-believable-than-written-ones" class="headerlink" title="Video testimonials are more authentic and believable than written ones"></a>Video testimonials are more authentic and believable than written ones</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/authentic-video-testimonial.jpg"                      alt="authentic video testimonial"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2129043/19576" target="_top" id="2129043">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2129043" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2129043/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Of course, written testimonials are still a great way to get your message across. However, video testimonials have some distinct advantages that make them more effective.</p><p>Consider this: Your prospective customer is going to be much more likely to click on the “read more” link in a written testimonial than they would be if you presented the same information in video form. That’s because videos are more memorable and emotional than text; they’re also more authentic and believable.</p><h3 id="Video-testimonials-help-build-relationships"><a href="#Video-testimonials-help-build-relationships" class="headerlink" title="Video testimonials help build relationships"></a>Video testimonials help build relationships</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/video-testimonial-build-relationships.jpg"                      alt="video testimonial build relationships"                ></p><p>As you know, there are lots of ways to market your business. But video testimonials are the most effective way to build relationships with your clients and prospects. Why? Because they’re personal, they allow you to showcase the client’s experience with your company, and they’re easy for people to share on social media!</p><p>If you haven’t done so already, we highly recommend that you start gathering video testimonials from all of your happy customers.

The stand is sturdy and durable enough so that users can make easy adjustments for pivot, tilt and height etc. If you need to mount this monitor on wall then you may have to make separate investment because this arrangement is not included in package.</p><p> One favourite feature of most of Dell users is the physical button placement of this monitor. They can be easily operated and the adjustments can be done quickly. The joystick based controls and resistive easy to click buttons make this monitor suitable for office use.</p><h4 id="2-Ports-and-Connectivity"><a href="#2-Ports-and-Connectivity" class="headerlink" title="2. Ports and Connectivity"></a>2. Ports and Connectivity</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dell-p2715q-ports.jpg"                      alt="dell-p2715q-ports"                ></p><p> There are several user friendly connectivity options on Dell P2715Q model. You will be able to access all essential ports ranging from USB 3.0 to HSMI 4.1 on this monitor. It has Display Port and Mini Display Port where the first one can also support daisy chain connectivity. The HDMI 2.0 and DisplayPort 1.2 assists users to enjoy games on this monitor with smooth rendering using 60Hz frequency control. It becomes much easier to enjoy wider input connection options on Dell P2715Q and the easy control adjustments allows easy access to all settings. There are 5 USB 3.0 ports and one 2.0 port that are enough for video transfers as well as for handling audio signals.</p><h2 id="Features-and-Performance"><a href="#Features-and-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Features and Performance"></a>Features and Performance</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dell-p2715q-menu.jpg"                      alt="dell-p2715q-menu"                ></p><p> The On Screen menu of Dell P2715Q is quite impressive and it is user friendly too. You will find everything well labelled on screen and text as well as icon allows precise view. The sad part is the users cannot enjoy high end calibrations on this monitor as here you can make adjustments only for few basic settings including RGB values, sharpness, contrast and brightness. People rate its settings menu to be precise and user friendly with higher simplicity. There are limited options on menu but they offer access to all useful properties.</p><h4 id="2-Color-Performance"><a href="#2-Color-Performance" class="headerlink" title="2. Color Performance"></a>2. Color Performance</h4><p> The color accuracy for Dell P2715Q is quite high and it ensures classic response for video and images. All details on screen are presented with very strong and rich color distribution on 3480x2160 pixel rating. It adjusts around 163 pixels&#x2F; inch on its 27 inch screen so that viewing experience can be enhanced with crisp details. The color gamut for sRGB spectrum provides 100% accuracy but in case of Adobe RGB it is limited to 79% only. You will be glad to know that Dell P2715Q can maintain very decent performance for contrast ratio that varies somewhere around 690:1 when brightness level is maximum whereas it falls to 650:1 range for half of the full brightness setting. This UHD monitor is rated high for its response for color information because most of the cheaper 4K screens can ensure accuracy only around 70 or 75 percent.</p><h4 id="3-Calibration-Capacity"><a href="#3-Calibration-Capacity" class="headerlink" title="3. Calibration Capacity"></a>3. Calibration Capacity</h4><p> As already discussed, the out of box performance for this monitor is limited to 100% sRGB accuracy and only 79% Adobe RGB rating with contrast ratio variation between 690 to 650:1. But when calibration is completed then it can show little improvement over performance. The color response gets improved up to 80% with Adobe RGB value and the maximum contrast ratio varied up to 720:1. But it does not show any improvement for lower range of contrast that still sits at 650:1. If we talk about brightness then it was observed to be 332lux. The best part is that this panel possess semi glossy coating so that it can deliver consistent performance in all environmental conditions. Users can easily access the calibration settings to switch between default and customized settings.</p><h4 id="4-Gaming-Performance"><a href="#4-Gaming-Performance" class="headerlink" title="4.Gaming Performance"></a>4.Gaming Performance</h4><p> The gaming capabilities of Dell P2715Q were tested with GTX 980 GPU and it lead to impressive performance. This monitor delivered incredible picture quality but when it is used to play action games that required fast frame rendering then the fps rating was not able to follow the game card response. No matter whether you are a crazy gamer or a professional graphic designer, this monitor can handle all your needs well with robust package of features and easy to access settings.</p><p> Watch the video below to get more information about the Dell P2715Q 4K Monitor.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> There is no doubt to say that Dell P2715Q offers incredible performance for almost all features as compared to other competitors that fall in same price range. Its durable stand allows users to handle it well for office as well as home based needs. There are lots of control options for easy settings of gamma, image quality etc that are not even offered by several expensive units. We can say that you need not to make any compromise for quality if you decide to buy Dell P2715Q. It will ensure you great performance for image and videos whereas games can be well played with customized settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/new-behind-the-brand-pewdiepies-financial-figures-unveiled/"><u>[New] Behind the Brand PewDiePie’s Financial Figures Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/new-chuckle-chest-premium-selection-of-gratuitous-gags/"><u>[New] Chuckle Chest Premium Selection of Gratuitous Gags</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-step-up-your-image-game-the-best-free-online-editors/"><u>[New] In 2024, Step Up Your Image Game The Best Free Online Editors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-handbook-for-hosting-zoom-events-on-youtube/"><u>[New] The Ultimate Handbook for Hosting Zoom Events on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-harnessing-the-power-of-video-playback-acceleration/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Harnessing the Power of Video Playback Acceleration</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/updated-exploring-every-aspect-of-picsart-a-compre-cookie-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Exploring Every Aspect of PicsArt A Compre Cookie for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/2024-approved-clear-the-clutter-erasing-stickers-from-your-tiktoks/"><u>2024 Approved Clear the Clutter Erasing Stickers From Your TikToks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/2024-approved-efficient-techniques-to-download-huge-numbers-of-tiktok-videos/"><u>2024 Approved Efficient Techniques to Download Huge Numbers of TikTok Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/change-location-on-yik-yak-for-your-honor-play-8t-to-enjoy-more-fun-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Change Location on Yik Yak For your Honor Play 8T to Enjoy More Fun | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/effortless-installation-of-intels-advanced-thunderbolt-controllers-ready-to-go/"><u>Effortless Installation of Intel's Advanced Thunderbolt Controllers – Ready to Go?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/in-2024-craft-captivating-gopro-time-lapse-footage-hacks/"><u>In 2024, Craft Captivating GoPro Time-Lapse Footage Hacks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/in-2024-innovative-solutions-for-your-ultimate-3d-viewing-needs/"><u>In 2024, Innovative Solutions for Your Ultimate 3D Viewing Needs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/prime-range-best-webcam-standers/"><u>Prime Range Best Webcam Standers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-able.techidaily.com/solving-the-tfla0002-finals-malfunction-a-step-by-step-guide/"><u>Solving the 'TFLA0002' Finals Malfunction: A Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134491/18498" target="_top" id="2134491">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134491" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134491/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

Rather than, you should simply describe the emotional shifts in the character, giving the actor some leeway to perform naturally.</p><ol><li><strong>Time</strong></li></ol><p>The determination of time is also a basic format.

It is a term used in old times when there were no advanced technology and printers were typed by small sticks called typewriters. It helps the viewer to understand the actions of the specific character.</p><h3 id="The-Function-of-slug-line-1"><a href="#The-Function-of-slug-line-1" class="headerlink" title="The Function of slug line"></a>The Function of slug line</h3><p>The main heading scene is responsible for starting an enthusiasm in the background. Slug lines establish the main scene properly. These are the scripts used to break up the length of a scene and can also be used to create pace in different types of scenes.

When writing this part, keep the following things in mind. Well first, dialogue cannot directly follow a slug line; instead, there are usually scenes and descriptions of action. Second, because the screenplay is not a novel, psychological or other non-visual descriptions must be avoided to convey what the “audience” can see. Rather than, you should simply describe the emotional shifts in the character, giving the actor some leeway to perform naturally.</p><ol><li><strong>Time</strong></li></ol><p>The determination of time is also a basic format. For example, DAY, NIGHT, etc. Generally, all of them are followed by a “-“.</p><ol><li><strong>An Example of Slug Line</strong></li></ol><p>INT.

Back in the days defining the internet was practically impossible, but people had an idea of what it would bring. However, Metaverse goes hand in hand with the avatar Metaverse.</p><p>As the name Meta suggests, Metaverse refers to a digital reality whose main objective is to blend in virtual reality, augmented reality, social media platforms, cryptocurrencies, and online gaming. Of course, we currently have platforms that feature avatars and virtual identities, but they include one flaw: all these features work on the same platform. This individuality syndrome is what Metaverse wishes to solve.</p><p>In our case, we are discussing the <strong>Metaverse Avatar</strong> and the most straightforward way to create one.

When Metaverse Avatar comes about, think of an icon representing you in the VR (Virtual Reality). Therefore, as technical experts talk of Metaverse, an avatar is equally essential. Why?

Back in the days defining the internet was practically impossible, but people had an idea of what it would bring. However, Metaverse goes hand in hand with the avatar Metaverse.</p><p>As the name Meta suggests, Metaverse refers to a digital reality whose main objective is to blend in virtual reality, augmented reality, social media platforms, cryptocurrencies, and online gaming. Of course, we currently have platforms that feature avatars and virtual identities, but they include one flaw: all these features work on the same platform.

When Metaverse Avatar comes about, think of an icon representing you in the VR (Virtual Reality). Therefore, as technical experts talk of Metaverse, an avatar is equally essential. Why? Because it is what you use to identify yourself in the digital world.</p><p>Think of it in the sense of how you go about opening a social media account. Typically, you will upload your photo as a visual representation of yourself on the platform. The same case happens when dealing with Metaverse; you need an avatar. However, in this case, you don’t need your real photo since you settle for a figure where you dress it and design it as per your taste and preference.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/what-is-an-avatar.jpg"                      alt="what is an avatar"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-What-does-Avatar-Mean-to-Metaverse-3"><a href="#Part-2-What-does-Avatar-Mean-to-Metaverse-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What does Avatar Mean to Metaverse?"></a>Part 2: What does Avatar Mean to Metaverse?</h2><p>As mentioned above, Metaverse is a technological evolution aiming to blend various platforms such as video games and social media and allow people to interact with each other efficiently.

Avatars refer to various individuals’ representations when dealing with the digital world. In simple terms, you use an avatar in place of you in the virtual world.
