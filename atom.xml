But what if you need the subtitle for another purpose? Then you might need to convert the file from zip to srt. But how do you do that? Well, that’s why we’ve created this article.</p><p>This article will introduce you to different methods that you can utilize to convert .zip to. srt on different devices. So, without wasting much of your time, let’s dive in to learn how to convert ZIP into SRT file.</p><ol><li><a href="#part5-1">How to Edit SRT with Filmora Software</a></li></ol><h2 id="Part-1-Why-are-movie-subtitles-on-the-Internet-nearly-always-in-zip-format"><a href="#Part-1-Why-are-movie-subtitles-on-the-Internet-nearly-always-in-zip-format" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why are movie subtitles on the Internet nearly always in .zip format?"></a>Part 1: Why are movie subtitles on the Internet nearly always in .zip format?</h2><p>The main reason why .srt subtitle files of a movie are provided in zip files is to help save space when you’re trying to download the files. Perhaps it’s a full season or series movie, its subtitles will be compressed in a zip file so they can all be downloaded with just one click. However, the ZIP file can’t be converted to SRT. You can only extract the srt files from ZIP using any standard quality.</p><p>Since you now understand that it’s impossible to convert .zip to .srt, the big question is how do you get SRT file out of ZIP? Well, read on to find an answer.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Get-SRT-file-in-a-Zip-File-without-software"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Get-SRT-file-in-a-Zip-File-without-software" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Get SRT file in a Zip File without software"></a>Part 2: How to Get SRT file in a Zip File without software</h2><p>There are several reasons ways to get SRT file in a Zip file, and amazingly, you can do so without software.

Find step-by-step guides on how you can blur photo background or even remove it from your image. Also, discover some of the best photo background stock websites that can help you out.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">How Can You Edit Photo Background Better?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How to Blur Photo Background?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to Remove Photo Background?</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">3 Best Websites to Download Stunning Photo Editing Background Images</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-Can-You-Edit-Photo-Background-Better"><a href="#Part-1-How-Can-You-Edit-Photo-Background-Better" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How Can You Edit Photo Background Better?"></a>Part 1: How Can You Edit Photo Background Better?</h2><p>Want to achieve the perfect photo editing background technique? What better way to do that than Photoshop?</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html" >Photoshop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Adobe is a premium-level image and graphics editor. Photoshop has held the gold standard for editing graphics and images for years. It is undoubtedly the best photo background editor app you can find to get your job done. With its precise tools and a sleek interface, it is relatively easy to insert your photo and edit background image.</p><p>Here is how you can edit and replace your image background in Photoshop:</p><p>Step 1: Select your Subject</p><p>Add your image to the interface of the program. From the toolbar on the left, tap the “Quick Selection” tool. Now drag the area of the image you want to select using the brush. You can hold the “Alt” key and drag the unwanted areas to remove them from the selection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-1.jpg"                      alt="use quick selection tool"                ></p><p>Step 2: Mask your Selection</p><p>Go to the options bar present at the top. Tap on “Select and Mask” to convert your selection into a mask. From the “Properties” panel, tap “View Mode” to determine how you want to see your selection. “Overlay” works best in general.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-2.jpg"                      alt="select the view mode"                ></p><p>Step 3: Polish the Edges</p><p>You can now further refine your selected part using the different tools offered by Photoshop. Use the “Quick Selection” tool to add or remove large areas. For hair and soft edges, you can use the “Refine Edge Brush” tool. The “Lasso&#x2F;Polygonal Lasso” tool can help manually draw areas for your selection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-3.jpg"                      alt="edit the image edges"                ></p><p>Step 4: Remove Residual Colors</p><p>From the panel at the right, select “Output Settings.” Check the box next to “Decontaminate Colors” to get rid of any leftover color fringe from your foreground. From “Output,” you now need to add a new layer by clicking on “New Layer with Layer Mask.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-4.jpg"                      alt="remove the selected color"                ></p><p>Step 5: Add a New Background</p><p>You can now paste the image you wish to add as a background for your photo. Position your image on the layer below the one with your foreground. You can resize your background image if required by selecting the “Free Transform” tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-5.jpg"                      alt="add new picture background"                ></p><p>Step 6: Fix the Colors</p><p>To blend the colors of your two images, select your foreground layer. Now go to “Image” and open “Adjustments.” From here, launch the “Match Color” popup window. Navigate to “Source” and select your image. From the “Layer” option, choose the layer you want to fix.</p><p>Tick the “Neutralize” box and adjust the “Luminance” and “Intensity” until you meet your requirements. You are all done now! Click “OK” and save your newly edited image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-6.jpg"                      alt="fix the image colors"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Blur-Photo-Background"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Blur-Photo-Background" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Blur Photo Background?"></a>Part 2: How to Blur Photo Background?</h2><p>A blurred background helps bring your image into focus. If you want a photo editor to blur background of your image, you can try Photoshop. Here are the steps for that:</p><p>Step 1: Isolate Subject</p><p>Isolate your subject on a separate layer by accessing the “Quick Selection” tool and clicking on the “Select Subject” button. You can use the “Lasso” tool to refine your selection. Click on “Select and Mask” and select the “Black and White View.” Now, choose the output to “New Layer with Layer Mask.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-7.jpg"                      alt="change the output"                ></p><p>Step 2: Expand the Selection</p><p>Hold the “CTRL” key and select your layer mask. Go to the “Select” tab, find and expand “Modify,” and tap “Expand.” Select a suitable number and tap “OK” Next, go to the “Edit” tab and select “Content-Aware Fill.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-8.jpg"                      alt="expand selection by pixels"                ></p><p>Step 3: Apply Photo Blur</p><p>Right-click on the background layer and choose “Convert to Smart Object.” Head over to the “Filter” tab, expand “Blur Gallery,” and choose “Tilt-Shift.” You can change the field lines to adjust the depth of field for your image and create a smooth transition. You can also control the intensity of the blur from the slider present on the right. Click “OK” and save your image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-9.jpg"                      alt="confirm blur settings"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Remove-Photo-Background"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Remove-Photo-Background" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Remove Photo Background?"></a>Part 3: How to Remove Photo Background?</h2><p>Want to remove the background from your image? Photoshop offers a photo-cut background solution for that. You can try that by following the steps below:</p><p>Step 1: Remove Background</p><p>To start with, insert your image and go to the Properties window. Under “Quick Options,” click on the “Remove Background” option. Photoshop will automatically detect your subject and remove the background.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-10.jpg"                      alt="tap on remove background"                ></p><p>Step 2: Refine Outline</p><p>To fix any mistake in your selection, go to the “Select” tab and click “Select and Mask.” From the toolbar, choose the “Quick Selection” tool. You can use the minus sign to get rid of the extra background or the plus sign to bring back the background. Click on “OK” and save your image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-11.jpg"                      alt="remove remaining backgroud"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-3-Best-Websites-to-Download-Stunning-Photo-Editing-Background-Images"><a href="#Part-4-3-Best-Websites-to-Download-Stunning-Photo-Editing-Background-Images" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: 3 Best Websites to Download Stunning Photo Editing Background Images"></a>Part 4: 3 Best Websites to Download Stunning Photo Editing Background Images</h2><p>Looking for a suitable background for your image?

What better way to do that than Photoshop?</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html" >Photoshop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Adobe is a premium-level image and graphics editor. Photoshop has held the gold standard for editing graphics and images for years. It is undoubtedly the best photo background editor app you can find to get your job done. With its precise tools and a sleek interface, it is relatively easy to insert your photo and edit background image.</p><p>Here is how you can edit and replace your image background in Photoshop:</p><p>Step 1: Select your Subject</p><p>Add your image to the interface of the program. From the toolbar on the left, tap the “Quick Selection” tool. Now drag the area of the image you want to select using the brush. You can hold the “Alt” key and drag the unwanted areas to remove them from the selection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-1.jpg"                      alt="use quick selection tool"                ></p><p>Step 2: Mask your Selection</p><p>Go to the options bar present at the top. Tap on “Select and Mask” to convert your selection into a mask. From the “Properties” panel, tap “View Mode” to determine how you want to see your selection. “Overlay” works best in general.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-2.jpg"                      alt="select the view mode"                ></p><p>Step 3: Polish the Edges</p><p>You can now further refine your selected part using the different tools offered by Photoshop. Use the “Quick Selection” tool to add or remove large areas. For hair and soft edges, you can use the “Refine Edge Brush” tool. The “Lasso&#x2F;Polygonal Lasso” tool can help manually draw areas for your selection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-3.jpg"                      alt="edit the image edges"                ></p><p>Step 4: Remove Residual Colors</p><p>From the panel at the right, select “Output Settings.” Check the box next to “Decontaminate Colors” to get rid of any leftover color fringe from your foreground. From “Output,” you now need to add a new layer by clicking on “New Layer with Layer Mask.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-4.jpg"                      alt="remove the selected color"                ></p><p>Step 5: Add a New Background</p><p>You can now paste the image you wish to add as a background for your photo. Position your image on the layer below the one with your foreground. You can resize your background image if required by selecting the “Free Transform” tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-5.jpg"                      alt="add new picture background"                ></p><p>Step 6: Fix the Colors</p><p>To blend the colors of your two images, select your foreground layer. Now go to “Image” and open “Adjustments.” From here, launch the “Match Color” popup window. Navigate to “Source” and select your image. From the “Layer” option, choose the layer you want to fix.</p><p>Tick the “Neutralize” box and adjust the “Luminance” and “Intensity” until you meet your requirements. You are all done now! Click “OK” and save your newly edited image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-6.jpg"                      alt="fix the image colors"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Blur-Photo-Background-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Blur-Photo-Background-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Blur Photo Background?"></a>Part 2: How to Blur Photo Background?</h2><p>A blurred background helps bring your image into focus. If you want a photo editor to blur background of your image, you can try Photoshop. Here are the steps for that:</p><p>Step 1: Isolate Subject</p><p>Isolate your subject on a separate layer by accessing the “Quick Selection” tool and clicking on the “Select Subject” button. You can use the “Lasso” tool to refine your selection. Click on “Select and Mask” and select the “Black and White View.” Now, choose the output to “New Layer with Layer Mask.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-7.jpg"                      alt="change the output"                ></p><p>Step 2: Expand the Selection</p><p>Hold the “CTRL” key and select your layer mask. Go to the “Select” tab, find and expand “Modify,” and tap “Expand.” Select a suitable number and tap “OK” Next, go to the “Edit” tab and select “Content-Aware Fill.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-8.jpg"                      alt="expand selection by pixels"                ></p><p>Step 3: Apply Photo Blur</p><p>Right-click on the background layer and choose “Convert to Smart Object.” Head over to the “Filter” tab, expand “Blur Gallery,” and choose “Tilt-Shift.” You can change the field lines to adjust the depth of field for your image and create a smooth transition. You can also control the intensity of the blur from the slider present on the right. Click “OK” and save your image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-9.jpg"                      alt="confirm blur settings"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Remove-Photo-Background-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Remove-Photo-Background-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Remove Photo Background?"></a>Part 3: How to Remove Photo Background?</h2><p>Want to remove the background from your image?

You can try that by following the steps below:</p><p>Step 1: Remove Background</p><p>To start with, insert your image and go to the Properties window. Under “Quick Options,” click on the “Remove Background” option. Photoshop will automatically detect your subject and remove the background.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-10.jpg"                      alt="tap on remove background"                ></p><p>Step 2: Refine Outline</p><p>To fix any mistake in your selection, go to the “Select” tab and click “Select and Mask.” From the toolbar, choose the “Quick Selection” tool.

The higher the brightness, the more luminous the picture will be. This means that bright and dark scenes will both be more easily identifiable.</p><p>In technical terms, the brightness of a video image is measured in nits. One nit is equal to one candela per square meter. If you have a television or monitor that is rated at 100 nits, it means it has a luminance of 100 Candelas per square meter (cd&#x2F;m2).</p><h4 id="What-should-my-video-brightness-be"><a href="#What-should-my-video-brightness-be" class="headerlink" title="What should my video brightness be?"></a>What should my video brightness be?</h4><p>The brightness of your videos should always be medium.

One nit is equal to one candela per square meter. If you have a television or monitor that is rated at 100 nits, it means it has a luminance of 100 Candelas per square meter (cd&#x2F;m2).</p><h4 id="What-should-my-video-brightness-be-3"><a href="#What-should-my-video-brightness-be-3" class="headerlink" title="What should my video brightness be?"></a>What should my video brightness be?</h4><p>The brightness of your videos should always be medium.

The article below can help you to make detailed comparison between VLC and MPC; probably you will soon be able to decide the right solution for your needs.</p><h2 id="Comparison-of-VLC-and-MPC"><a href="#Comparison-of-VLC-and-MPC" class="headerlink" title="Comparison of VLC and MPC"></a>Comparison of VLC and MPC</h2><h3 id="User-Interface"><a href="#User-Interface" class="headerlink" title="User Interface"></a>User Interface</h3><p>There are very limited things to talk about user interfaces of both these software; they are quite simple. The design for MPC-HC is actually derived from its predecessor Media Player Classic and it originally follows the design track of Windows XP&#x2F;95 Media player. On the other side, VLC offers quite clunky icons with deep orange color that most of the time appear irritating to eyes.</p><p>The real difference lies between their features and menus where MPC-HC offers much organized service. It keeps all things at right place for both full screen and small screen modes whereas in case of VLC, users often need to organise a search for their desired content. MPC-HC retains its size even when video loops are formed but VLC immediately holds back the control to whole screen whenever playbacks start.</p><h3 id="Video-Support"><a href="#Video-Support" class="headerlink" title="Video Support"></a>Video Support</h3><p>When video files were tested on both these platforms, MPC-HC provides decent results. Even the 4K content was displayed well on MPC-HC but VLC caused little loss for frames while missing the smoothness in between.</p><p>MPC performed better for almost all media file tests but its performance decayed little bit with old MPEG-1 file format. However, both these players found difficulties for seeking track over WMV files but VLC somehow managed the longer jumps. When tests were performed for DVD and VCDs then both players performed better while handling all menus and elements with ease. Performance for non-protected type Blu-ray files was also significant in both cases.</p><p>The sad thing about VLC is that when it finds some problem for playing any media file then it often goes into infinite loops and they can be finally broken only with task manager. But in case of MPC-HC, when some files appear un supported to this platform it simply says no to it.</p><h3 id="Audio-Support"><a href="#Audio-Support" class="headerlink" title="Audio Support"></a>Audio Support</h3><p>MPC-HC as well as VLC, both these file formats supported WAV files perfectly up to 96KHz up to 32 bits. It also extends great support to standard compressed media file formats like APE&lt; FLAC, M4A, MP3 and Opus. You cannot play .VQF files on both these platforms.</p><p>VLC also finds trouble with Windows lossless files but MPC-HC can handle them well along with Apple Lossless content. In case of CD based playbacks, both these players worked well whereas performance of VLC was much smoother for track switching needs.</p><h3 id="Subtitles"><a href="#Subtitles" class="headerlink" title="Subtitles"></a>Subtitles</h3><p>For most of the subtitle tests, MPC-HC performed with acceptable quality but in case of VLC you have to drag subtitle file on top of the movie so that it can play it in synchronism. MPC-HC handles subtitles as playable files and let them proceed normally.</p><h3 id="Streaming-Support"><a href="#Streaming-Support" class="headerlink" title="Streaming Support"></a>Streaming Support</h3><p>This service is simply incredible in case of VLC and that is why it is well known as VideoLAN. Users simply need to copy video URL from internet and get it pasted on Open Media Stream dialogue box of VLV. You will definitely have great streaming experience for almost all YouTube videos but it is advised not to try such tricks with MPC-HC because it cannot handle.</p><h3 id="Photo-Format-Support"><a href="#Photo-Format-Support" class="headerlink" title="Photo Format Support"></a>Photo Format Support</h3><p>None of these software platforms is actually designed to handle images and you should not even expect slide show playbacks from them. But still during tests, VLC was able to open many images except JPEG and PNG files whereas MPC-HC effectively displayed BMP images, uncompressed as well as compressed TIFF, animated and static GIF, PNG and TGA files. But MPC-HC reported sudden failure for JPEG content; however it was later displayed well. If you don’t need to access JPEG content then MPC-HC can be a suitable option for your needs as it can handle most of the extensions with ease.</p><h3 id="Support-for-Filters-Shaders-and-FX"><a href="#Support-for-Filters-Shaders-and-FX" class="headerlink" title="Support for Filters, Shaders and FX"></a>Support for Filters, Shaders and FX</h3><p>VLC as well as MPC-HC, both these players work with standard speed and you can jump to different points of material with ease. However, VLC is well known for its incredible smoothness offered for slow playbacks so that original pitch can be retained; whereas this thing is not so in MPC-HC. MPC-HC further offers more advanced controls like interactive magnification etc that you may find behind dialogue boxes.</p><p>It is also possible to use advanced filters in case of MPC-HC, the range includes emboss, edge sharpen and gray scale options. The facility of FX and shaders is good in case of VLC also.</p><h3 id="Odds-and-Ends"><a href="#Odds-and-Ends" class="headerlink" title="Odds and Ends"></a>Odds and Ends</h3><p>VLC offers great controls over volume whereas MPC-HC follows boosts for dialogue delivery only. MPC-HC is observed to open up faster and its drag and drop features are much faster including 4K content support but all these things are even equally good for VLC platform too.</p><h2 id="VLC-and-MPC-Alternatives"><a href="#VLC-and-MPC-Alternatives" class="headerlink" title="VLC and MPC Alternatives"></a>VLC and MPC Alternatives</h2><p>If you are searching for few <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best free video players for PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as useful alternatives to both VLC and MPC then these three can be good choice for you:</p><h3 id="1-GOM-Player"><a href="#1-GOM-Player" class="headerlink" title="1.

The original version of the drone was incredibly fun to fly but the Bebop 2 makes new improvements in performance, battery life and video quality. Although the controls for the Bebop are not as precise as some other types of drones on the market like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >DJI Phantom 4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the performance and the attractive video that this drone can capture make it a true performance leader in the market.</p><p> The Parrot Bebop is a drone that was in development for over two years since the initial release of the original drone. It comes with a very reasonable price point at under $600 and it is capable of completing over 25 min of autonomous flight before going back to base. The specs on this drone make it a leader in amateur <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >filmmaking, photographs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and more. This is a drone that’s well-suited for use both indoors and outdoors and they commonly go on sale allowing many people to start up their drone hobby without having to invest thousands of dollars.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/parrot-bebop-2.jpg"                      alt="parrot bebop 2"                ></p><h2 id="Pros-and-Cons-of-Parrot-Bebop-2"><a href="#Pros-and-Cons-of-Parrot-Bebop-2" class="headerlink" title="Pros and Cons of Parrot Bebop 2"></a>Pros and Cons of Parrot Bebop 2</h2><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Tt’s extremely lightweight design</li><li>The cameras respectable with a fisheye lens capable of capturing 30 frames per second at 1080 P</li><li>The device can also capture 14 megapixel shots with fairly stable movement</li><li>The battery life has more than doubled allowing up to 25 min of flight time</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Camera functions have not been improved greatly from the previous version</li><li>Image distortions</li><li>The control sticks can also sometimes be quick to go unresponsive long before the parrot reaches its extended service range</li></ul><h2 id="Complete-review-for-Parrot-Bebop-2"><a href="#Complete-review-for-Parrot-Bebop-2" class="headerlink" title="Complete review for Parrot Bebop 2"></a>Complete review for Parrot Bebop 2</h2><h4 id="1-Features-and-specs"><a href="#1-Features-and-specs" class="headerlink" title="1.  Features and specs"></a>1.  Features and specs</h4><p> The main features for this device are it’s improved stable movement with a three axis accelerometer and ultrasound sensor. These improved sensors and waypoint controls make the process of actually flying one of these drones very easy. The motor is also known for its speed and its capable of reaching a height of 100 m in just 18 seconds after takeoff. This is a very fast and highflying drone. The improved battery life of up to 25 min. with a 2700 mA battery is a considerable improvement for this drone as well. The two nicest features which are available for new drone flyers are the return home feature where you can set a waypoint for the drone to land after it runs out of battery as well as the free flight three application. The free flight application is one of the easiest ways that you can control your drone with the help of a tablet or smartphone and set waypoints for capturing the shots you want.</p><h4 id="2-Design"><a href="#2-Design" class="headerlink" title="2.  Design"></a>2.  Design</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/parrot-bebop-2-design.png"                      alt="parrot bebop 2 design"                ></p><p> The design of this drone has definitely been improved for performance as well as resiliency. The previous version of the parrot was fairly simple to break but this newest version is much stronger and easier to control especially with the help of the application. This is a drone that has definitely been designed with beginner users in mind. The only design flaw with this drone is that the camera was not updated in any way. Parrot makes the process of ordering extra parts extremely simple through their online store and you can keep this drone running over an extended amount of time quite easily.</p><h4 id="3-Battery-Life"><a href="#3-Battery-Life" class="headerlink" title="3.  Battery Life"></a>3.  Battery Life</h4><p> The battery life on this drone is excellent for the type of video that shoots as well as the controls offered on the device. Previous versions of the parrot could only fly for 11 min. but this drone can fly uninterrupted for 25 minutes or less. The improved battery life on this drone is comparable with others in the price point but not many of them feature the same quality of image.</p><h4 id="4-Flight-performance"><a href="#4-Flight-performance" class="headerlink" title="4.  Flight performance"></a>4.  Flight performance</h4><p> This is a high-performing drone that has great stability controls and an application that can ease the process of flight. The return home feature helps to protect the drone in the event of a battery problem or when the user is finished filming. As landing these drones can be some of the most difficult aspects of operation, flight performance with a return home feature is one of the easiest ways to protect it.</p><h4 id="5-Control-Range"><a href="#5-Control-Range" class="headerlink" title="5.  Control Range"></a>5.  Control Range</h4><p> Parrot does have an accessory to extend the control range of the Bebop 2 to 2 km. The drone out of the box has a range of 300 m to work with when using the controls. If you plan on using the drone regularly, the extra control range can be very helpful.</p><h4 id="6-Camera"><a href="#6-Camera" class="headerlink" title="6.  Camera"></a>6.  Camera</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/parrot-bebop-2-camera.jpg"                      alt="parrot bebop 2 camera"                ></p><p> The 14 megapixel fisheye lens camera is backed up by 8 GB of onboard storage. The cameras capable of capturing 1080 P video at 30 frames per second and it does produce a fairly good quality image. Some users have made light complaints about lens flare and a few other distortion qualities but overall, it’s difficult to find a drone and camera built in combo that can produce an image this good, for the same price.</p><h4 id="7-The-free-flight-app"><a href="#7-The-free-flight-app" class="headerlink" title="7.

It was very clear from the developers that they are still launching games keeping the PC and Smart Phones in mind. These are still the most popular platforms where 49 percent of the developers made their latest release on PC&#x2F;Mac, around 41 percent chose smart phones and tablets to be the best medium.</p><p> It is quite clear from the discussion that the game developers prefer PC&#x2F;Laptops&#x2F;Mac over any other devices to release their games. But, this year’s survey came up with a different result where 59.7 percent developers preferably chose PC&#x2F;Mac followed by 48.3 percent developers who chose virtual reality headsets for their upcoming games. So, we can say that despite the indomitable popularity of the PC and Mac, virtual reality is also gaining a strong ground.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/resource/google-cardbaorad-1.jpg"                      alt="google-cardbaorad-1"                ></p><h2 id="The-VR-gaming-development-is-truly-rising-then"><a href="#The-VR-gaming-development-is-truly-rising-then" class="headerlink" title="The VR gaming development is truly rising then"></a>The VR gaming development is truly rising then</h2><p> Is it really the right time to make comment like virtual reality is really uprising as a gaming platform? If you take the year of year survey report, yes the result shows a significant uptick for the interest of this platform. If we look back at the last year’s survey, it revealed that only 33.4 percent of the developers were interested to develop games for VR platforms. If you consider in terms of interest, VR was placed behind the PC&#x2F;Mac, PlayStation 4, smartphones or tablets. But, considering this year’s data, we can see more advancement in the interest for the VR platform! More and more European developers are now getting interested to develop games for VR platforms that the smartphones or tablets.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/resource/vr-gaming1.jpg"                      alt="vr-gaming"                ></p><p> This clears the air that VR is turning to be an emerging platform for the European game developers but, which one is preferred more by the professional game developers – is it the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive or something else for that matter? The survey also includes a detailed report on that as well. Asking about which VR platform they are using – 23.1 percent developers said they are using Rift, Vive is slightly behind with 22 percent developers’ preferences. There is PlayStation VR headset as well with 11.8 percent preferences.</p><p> However, despite having such acceptance by the professional game developers, the confidence for the VR games market seems to have dropped a bit – at least the recent survey is showing something like that. Last year, 71.7 percent of the game developers considered VR to be a sustainable long-term market while in this year, it slipped a little with 68.8 percent developers are thinking VR could be a long sustaining gaming market.</p><h2 id="About-the-European-VR-game-makers-and-their-funding"><a href="#About-the-European-VR-game-makers-and-their-funding" class="headerlink" title="About the European VR game makers and their funding"></a>About the European VR game makers and their funding</h2><p> Funding for the games has always remained one of the prime concerns for the game developers and publishers. You know that it takes large amounts to be invested for the games. When it comes to the funding policies for the European game developers, most of them are covering the entire expenses using their own funds. Take a look at what the survey report has to say about that. Asking about the sources of the fund for the games 57.8 percent said that their funds come from the company’s existing fund while contrary to this, 32.9 percent game developers said that they manage their own fund from their personal accounts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/resource/vr-developer.jpg"                      alt="vr-developer"                ></p><p> We know that crowdsourced funding is also a preferable way to manage funds but, this seems not very convenient for the VR game developers since a very poor percentage (5.2) of the developers replied that they are working on games the fund of which is crowdsourced. While some developers consider this as an awful idea, some mentioned this to be a tricky process.</p><p> Overall, this is what cooking inside the VR gaming world and this survey report explains the different aspects of virtual reality that clearly presents the state of the VR industry on this year – 2016. Hopefully, we will come across much more advancement to this process in the coming years since gaming on VR headsets is massively exciting and fun.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-visionary-choices-top-10-live-sports-streaming-apps-focus-on-football/"><u>2024 Approved  Visionary Choices  Top 10 Live Sports Streaming Apps, Focus on Football</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/a-collection-of-trendy-tiktok-backgrounds-for-2024/"><u>A Collection of Trendy TikTok Backgrounds for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/the-next-big-thing-in-short-form-videos-wholl-take-the-lead-likes-or-tiktok-for-2024/"><u>The Next Big Thing in Short Form Videos  Who'll Take the Lead, Likes or TikTok for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/achieving-stunning-iphone-hdr-results/"><u>Achieving Stunning iPhone HDR Results</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/25plus-futuristic-insights-on-ar-enhanced-worlds-for-2024/"><u>25+ Futuristic Insights on AR-Enhanced Worlds for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-optimizing.techidaily.com/in-2024-transform-your-skype-speech-patterns-with-these-5-must-have-voice-change-tools/"><u>In 2024, Transform Your Skype Speech Patterns with These 5 Must-Have Voice Change Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/androids-leading-image-editing-does-pickup-reign-supreme/"><u>Android's Leading Image Editing  Does PickUp Reign Supreme?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-transform-your-instagram-reels-into-high-quality-mp4-files-anywhere/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Transform Your Instagram Reels Into High-Quality MP4 Files Anywhere</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-understanding-the-use-of-burst-feature-in-gopros/"><u>2024 Approved  Understanding the Use of Burst Feature in GoPros</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/alight-motion-comprehensive-review-for-2024/"><u>Alight Motion Comprehensive Review for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unmatched-clarity-in-filming-top-rated-camera-stabilizers-guide/"><u>2024 Approved  Unmatched Clarity in Filming  Top-Rated Camera Stabilizers Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-youtube-live-streaming-made-easy-for-newcomers-without-thousand-subscribers/"><u>2024 Approved  YouTube Live Streaming Made Easy for Newcomers without Thousand Subscribers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/advanced-subtitle-tools-navigate-through-the-best-10-web-edits-for-2024/"><u>Advanced Subtitle Tools -

This would allow you to select the image which has been most perfectly captured. Burst Mode is nothing but a sequence of still photos which have been captured just like a video footage.The Hero5 Black cameras are capable of recording videos up to 240 fps which means it can take about 240 images per second. In this article we are going to discuss everything you need to know about the GoPro Burst Mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gopro-hero5-black-1.jpg"                      alt="文字"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M14ATO0/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01M14ATO0&linkId=5ce54ea937ecffa6b1b8056b6922abaa" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Turning-the-burst-mode-on-your-GoPro-on"><a href="#Turning-the-burst-mode-on-your-GoPro-on" class="headerlink" title="Turning the burst mode on your GoPro on"></a>Turning the burst mode on your GoPro on</h2><ol><li>First you have to switch on your camera and press the ‘mode’ to see the shooting mode menu</li><li>Now you need to hit the ‘mode’ button twice to go to Burst mode</li><li>Finally just click on ‘rate’ to choose the burst rate</li></ol><p> The GoPro Hero5 Black models can capture between 30 frame per second to 3 frame per second. Use the touch screen to select your frame rate. Once the burst rate has been selected you need to attend to a few more settings-</p><ol start="4"><li>Click the FOV to choose field of view</li><li>Click the ‘mode’ button again to choose the metering preference – full frame or spot</li></ol><p> Regular full frame metering: Metering or light metering needs to be selected so as to adjust the level of brightness of the image. Your GoPro cam would automatically adjust the brightness level according to the subject in the frame.</p><p> Spot Metering: This option supersedes the regular metering style. Here the whole picture is metered on the basis of a hypothetical spot in the middle of the picture. This can come in handy while capturing a specific object like people in crowd or an animal from a distance.</p><ol start="6"><li>The ‘mode’ button has to be clicked once more to turn on&#x2F;off the ProTune You don’t have to bother about ProTune unless you are considering creating a video out of the images. If you just want to view your clips then there is no reason to turn on ProTune. ProTune is known to affect some of the factors linked with the captured images such as colour, FOV, sharpness etc. It allows the professional editors to play with a number of editing options for adjusting the footage.</li></ol><h2 id="The-Burst-Mode-in-your-GoPro-is-all-ready-to-use"><a href="#The-Burst-Mode-in-your-GoPro-is-all-ready-to-use" class="headerlink" title="The Burst Mode in your GoPro is all ready to use"></a>The Burst Mode in your GoPro is all ready to use</h2><p> Now that you have learned everything about using the Burst Mode on your GoPro, you just need to select the ‘exit’ button or click on the ‘setting tag’ button (which is just to the left of the ‘mode’ button) for saving the present settings and then exit. The GoPro Burst Mode is now all set up in your camera. All you need to do is select your resolution, speed and the metering before you hit the shutter.

Certainly, it is tough, maybe terrible even, to make someone look cool while having a VR headset on their head. But with the design of 360 VR, it is quite sure that engineers have made no attempt to resolve this issue. The headset sports a look similar to what common in the 1980s imagined a futuristic invention would look like. It actually looks like a product with a low-cost, NHS-prescribed article for modifying poor vision.</p><h3 id="Accessories-of-LG-360-VR"><a href="#Accessories-of-LG-360-VR" class="headerlink" title="Accessories of LG 360 VR"></a>Accessories of LG 360 VR</h3><p> Since it is connected via USB Type-C connector, so the company provides it with the package.

Well, many other necessary things are also provided with.</p><h3 id="Product-Packaging-of-LG-360-VR"><a href="#Product-Packaging-of-LG-360-VR" class="headerlink" title="Product Packaging of LG 360 VR"></a>Product Packaging of LG 360 VR</h3><p> Well, the packaging is quite simple as all the other products of LG. It comes in a simple box will all the accessories in it. It is okay to say that the packaging is safe, but should be dealt with care, in the end, it is a delicate product. Everything looks good until it is inside the box.</p><h3 id="How-to-Set-up-LG-360-VR-headset"><a href="#How-to-Set-up-LG-360-VR-headset" class="headerlink" title="How to Set up LG 360 VR headset"></a>How to Set up LG 360 VR headset</h3><ul><li>First of all, connect the USB connector of the headset on to your smartphone. It will take a few minutes. When the headset is on, the screen of your phone will become off, and now you can use your phone as a touchpad.</li><li>The headset will not work normally when it is connected to the LG G5 phone if you have connected LG Hi-Fi plus, LG CAM Plus or any other device that is not of the G5 module.</li><li>The LG 360 VR turns off if your phone remains idle without playing any video or application for a minimum of 15 minutes in order to save the battery of your phone.</li><li>Other than that, the headset will connect to the phone if the battery of your phone is too low or the phone is too hot.</li></ul><h3 id="LG-360-VR-Performance"><a href="#LG-360-VR-Performance" class="headerlink" title="LG 360 VR Performance"></a>LG 360 VR Performance</h3><p> When you ponder that it is the LG G5 phone that is actually doing all the work in terms of actually driving the 360 VR’s practices, you would at least assume steady performance. We know that the G5 is one of the most influential smartphones present in the market, including an Adreno 530 GPU, Snapdragon 820 and a 4GB RAM. Unfortunately, the first experience with the 360 VR’s performance is unsatisfactory to say the minimum. Having a 920 x 720 resolution per eye, this headset provides a much lower resolution rate as compared to all other virtual reality headsets present in the market.

It was actually released with LG G5 and used to promote this phone. LG 360 VR has an internal built-in display, unlike the Gear VR designed by Samsung, which also provides a unit plugging for power directly to the phone. The headset can be controlled from the smartphone screen by just tapping and swiping. LG, however, designed this device to enjoy the virtual reality experience, but the device is not up to the mark. If you haven’t bought this device yet, it is highly advised not to buy this one. It is not a very good design and its performance is also not very good.</p><p> However, with a cost of around $200 to $220, LG 360 VR is a very expensive device with a doubly cost of Samsung Gear VR. In addition to that, it only is compatible with LG G5. Now, it was better if, with this price and compatibility of just one, 360 VR provided a better experience, but it is not a good device to use.</p><p> In crux, LG’s this device isn’t somewhat you’d want to attire in public, and when you ponder that one of the assistances of a mobile headset is that you are not tied to a luxurious gaming rig, LG certainly should have put in some more energy when it comes to the design of 360 VR. If we are going to turn out to be a realm of VR zombies with headsets continually tied to our skulls, then we would probably want those units which let us live in style.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-top-5-panoramic-capture-models/"><u>2024 Approved  Top 5 Panoramic Capture Models</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-ultimate-6-tech-for-subtitle-creation-in-video/"><u>2024 Approved  Ultimate 6 Tech for Subtitle Creation in Video</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-visionary-choices-top-10-live-sports-streaming-apps-focus-on-football/"><u>2024 Approved  Visionary Choices  Top 10 Live Sports Streaming Apps, Focus on Football</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/how-to-use-periscope-the-complete-guide/"><u>How to Use Periscope  The Complete Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-why-does-imovie-adjust-video-borders/"><u>2024 Approved  Why Does iMovie Adjust Video Borders?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/1716183955941-updated-how-to-reverse-image-search-instagram-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] How to Reverse Image Search Instagram for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unmatched-clarity-in-filming-top-rated-camera-stabilizers-guide/"><u>2024 Approved  Unmatched Clarity in Filming  Top-Rated Camera Stabilizers Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-what-to-do-with-icloud-drives-desktop-anddocuments-access-in-sierra/"><u>2024 Approved  What to Do with iCloud Drive’s Desktop &Documents Access in Sierra</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/regain-control-over-silent-slack-alerts-in-win-11/"><u>Regain Control Over Silent Slack Alerts in Win 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/top-6-non-adged-android-recorders/"><u>Top 6 Non-Adged Android Recorders</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-the-best-start-streamlined-tools-for-novice-game-editors-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Best Start  Streamlined Tools for Novice Game Editors for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/alight-motion-comprehensive-review-for-2024/"><u>Alight Motion Comprehensive Review for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/how-to-turn-on-av1-settings-on-youtube-and-why-you-should-do-it-for-2024/"><u>How to Turn on AV1 Settings on YouTube and Why You Should Do It for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/artistic-excellence-foremost-ios-art-tools-for-2024/"><u>Artistic Excellence  Foremost iOS Art Tools for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-investigating-financial-gains-from-product-reviews/"><u>In 2024, Investigating Financial Gains From Product Reviews</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-visual-clarity-at-your-fingertips-removing-backgrounds-using-photopea/"><u>2024 Approved  Visual Clarity at Your Fingertips  Removing Backgrounds Using Photopea</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-premium-nintendo-switch-combat-series-list-max-156/"><u>[Updated] Premium Nintendo Switch Combat Series List (Max 156)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-key-elements-in-constructing-a-podcast-rss-feed/"><u>In 2024, Key Elements in Constructing a Podcast RSS Feed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-decoding-youtubes-seo-mysteries-keyword-research-explained/"><u>In 2024, Decoding YouTube's SEO Mysteries  Keyword Research Explained</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/apples-tunes-in-the-frame-of-reality/"><u>Apple's Tunes in the Frame of Reality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-visionenhance-pro-high-fidelity-video-upgrade/"><u>2024 Approved  VisionEnhance Pro -

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Achieving-Stunning-iPhone-HDR-Results"><a href="#Achieving-Stunning-iPhone-HDR-Results" class="headerlink" title="Achieving Stunning iPhone HDR Results"></a>Achieving Stunning iPhone HDR Results</h2><p>Are you annoyed that your iPhone camera is unable to capture what your eyes see? Well, no need to waste your energy. The iPhone camera offers just the perfect feature to counter this problem - the HDR feature.</p><p>Most people have to use photo editing software to fix the exposures of photos, but luckily for us, we don’t need that.</p><p>In this article, we will give you a brief overview of HDR photography and then guide you on how to shoot HDR photos with an iPhone.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-HDR-Photography-for-iPhone"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-HDR-Photography-for-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is HDR Photography for iPhone?"></a>Part 1: What is HDR Photography for iPhone?</h2><p>HDR is short for High Dynamic Range, and it refers to a photography technique where multiple exposures of a scene are combined to create one well-lit picture. It captures a scene’s darkest and lightest tone and shows them as such in the final photo.</p><p>Apple introduced the HDR feature back in 2010 on iPhone 4. It was a breakthrough for the company, further enhancing the iPhone camera. Since then, all the succeeding models of the iPhone have the HDR feature.</p><p>However, Apple has advanced its HDR technology with the passage of time. Before the release of the iPhone 12, Apple worked with HDR10. With the iPhone 12, Apple inculcated Dolby Vision HDR, becoming the first to roll out Dolby Vision in a mobile handset.</p><p>Without the HDR feature, your iPhone camera is not capable of capturing a high-contrast scene. This will lead you to having exposure problems in your pictures.</p><p>Your scene might have dark tones that are well exposed with the right colors and details, but the bright areas might be over-exposed with no shade or detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-shoot-hdr-photos-with-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="hdr shoot"                ></p><p>On the other hand, your scene might have bright tones that are well-exposed with the right color and details, but the dark areas are too dark to show the details.</p><p>Alt text: HDR shoot with different exposure</p><p>With the iPhone’s HDR feature, you can get a perfectly exposed photo showing details simultaneously in light and dark tones.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-shoot-hdr-photos-with-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="hdr shoot with different exposure"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-take-an-HDR-Photo-with-your-iPhone-Camera"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-take-an-HDR-Photo-with-your-iPhone-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to take an HDR Photo with your iPhone Camera?"></a>Part 2: How to take an HDR Photo with your iPhone Camera?</h2><p>Now that we know how HDR helps make our pictures pop out, let’s look at how you can take an HDR photo with your iPhone camera.</p><h3 id="How-to-take-HDR-photos-on-iPhone-X-iPhone-11-models-and-iPhone-12-models"><a href="#How-to-take-HDR-photos-on-iPhone-X-iPhone-11-models-and-iPhone-12-models" class="headerlink" title="How to take HDR photos on iPhone X, iPhone 11 models, and iPhone 12 models?"></a>How to take HDR photos on iPhone X, iPhone 11 models, and iPhone 12 models?</h3><p>Here is a step-by-step guide for you to follow. This guide is applicable for iPhone XS, iPhone XR, iPhone 11 models, and iPhone 12 models.</p><h5 id="Step1Go-to-Settings"><a href="#Step1Go-to-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step1Go to Settings"></a>Step1Go to Settings</h5><p>The first step for you is to go to your iPhone Settings. Here, click on the Camera app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-shoot-hdr-photos-with-iphone-3.jpg"                      alt="go to settings and click on camera"                ></p><h5 id="Step2Adjust-the-Settings"><a href="#Step2Adjust-the-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step2Adjust the Settings"></a>Step2Adjust the Settings</h5><p>Here, ensure that the Smart HDR (or Auto HDR in iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X) is toggled off. The HDR option will not be available in the camera if you do not switch this off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-shoot-hdr-photos-with-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="turn on smart hdr"                ></p><p>Also, ensure that the “Keep Normal Photo” toggle is on. Having this enabled will let your camera save a non-HDR version of the photo as well as the HDR version.</p><h5 id="Step3Head-to-the-Camera-App"><a href="#Step3Head-to-the-Camera-App" class="headerlink" title="Step3Head to the Camera App"></a>Step3Head to the Camera App</h5><p>Once you have adjusted the setting, open the Camera app.</p><h5 id="Step4Enable-HDR"><a href="#Step4Enable-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Step4Enable HDR"></a>Step4Enable HDR</h5><p>At the top of the screen, you will see an HDR option. Tap on it to enable (or disable) it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-shoot-hdr-photos-with-iphone-5.jpg"                      alt="go the camera and click on hrd from top menu"                ></p><p>In older iPhones such as iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, and earlier, you have the option to set it to Auto, On, or Off. Choose the “On” option.</p><p>You can now take HDR photos with your iPhone!</p><h3 id="How-to-take-HDR-Photos-on-iPhone-13"><a href="#How-to-take-HDR-Photos-on-iPhone-13" class="headerlink" title="How to take HDR Photos on iPhone 13?"></a>How to take HDR Photos on iPhone 13?</h3><p>In the iPhone 13 models, the steps for taking an HDR photo are slightly different. The first few steps are the same. Go to Settings &gt; Camera. Under the HDR section, find the “HDR” option and turn the toggle on.</p><p>Once the toggle is on, go to the Camera app. You will see the HDR option where you can turn it On&#x2F;Off or set it to Automatic.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Not-to-Have-Two-Same-Photos-When-Shot-with-HDR-on-your-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-Not-to-Have-Two-Same-Photos-When-Shot-with-HDR-on-your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Not to Have Two Same Photos When Shot with HDR on your iPhone?"></a>Part 3: How Not to Have Two Same Photos When Shot with HDR on your iPhone?</h2><p>You may notice that when you shoot photos with HDR on your iPhone, your camera roll shows two identical pictures. This happens when the “Keep Normal Photo” setting is enabled in the iPhone Camera Settings. This setting is only available on iPhone X and earlier.</p><p>For the latest versions, you can only see the Smart HDR option. By default, Smart HDR does not save the non-HDR version of the image.</p><p>The “Keep Normal Photo” option is helpful in instances where you might have to compare the HDR and non-HDR versions. You may even prefer the non-HDR version in some cases.</p><p>But the side effect of this feature is that it becomes a nuisance to delete the other versions, and it also takes up space.</p><p>Here is how you can disable this setting and avoid having two same photos.</p><h5 id="Step1Go-to-Settings-1"><a href="#Step1Go-to-Settings-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1Go to Settings"></a>Step1Go to Settings</h5><p>Go to your iPhone Settings and tap on the Camera app.</p><h5 id="Step2Disable-the-“Keep-Normal-Photo”-Option"><a href="#Step2Disable-the-“Keep-Normal-Photo”-Option" class="headerlink" title="Step2Disable the “Keep Normal Photo” Option"></a>Step2Disable the “Keep Normal Photo” Option</h5><p>You will see a “Keep Normal Photo” toggle in the HDR panel. Turn the toggle off.</p><p>Once the toggle is off, you can go and take an HDR photo. The camera app will no longer save the non-HDR version of the image.</p><h2 id="Part-4-iPhone-Camera-Smart-HDR-Not-Working-Why"><a href="#Part-4-iPhone-Camera-Smart-HDR-Not-Working-Why" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: iPhone Camera Smart HDR Not Working, Why?"></a>Part 4: iPhone Camera Smart HDR Not Working, Why?</h2><p>The iPhone’s HDR option enables you to get great shots. Apple introduced a “Smart HDR” option on iPhone where the camera shoots photos in HDR (when necessary) by default. This option ensures that users don’t have to go to great lengths to get amazing shots.</p><p>However, there may be instances when you feel that the “Smart HDR” option is not working.</p><h3 id="Scenario-1-No-HDR-toggle-option-in-the-Camera-App"><a href="#Scenario-1-No-HDR-toggle-option-in-the-Camera-App" class="headerlink" title="Scenario 1: No HDR toggle option in the Camera App"></a><strong>Scenario 1: No HDR toggle option in the Camera App</strong></h3><p>There may be a case where you open your Camera app to take a picture in HDR but there is no HDR option available to you. This is usually the case with iPhone 13 models, and its pro variants.</p><p>Well, the reason behind it is that Apple has added a new feature in these models that the Camera is set to capture HDR shots by default. So, users do not have the option to control the HDR feature.</p><p>It certainly takes away the control that users had in their shots because not all HDR images turn out to be perfect. Especially while zooming into things, the images start looking like a painting. However, it works just fine in most cases.</p><h3 id="Scenario-2-No-HDR-feature-for-Photos-enabled-in-iPhone-XS-Max"><a href="#Scenario-2-No-HDR-feature-for-Photos-enabled-in-iPhone-XS-Max" class="headerlink" title="Scenario 2: No HDR feature for Photos enabled in iPhone XS Max"></a><strong>Scenario 2: No HDR feature for Photos enabled in iPhone XS Max</strong></h3><p>Certain iPhone XS Max users are facing a problem where the Photos app does not show whether the image is an HDR image or not. Previously, users could see an “HDR” tag on their photos. However, recently the tags are not visible anymore.</p><p>Worry not, this does not mean that your Smart HDR is not working. You can check this by disabling Smart HDR from Settings &gt; Camera. Once Smart HDR is disabled, go to the Camera app and take a picture without HDR. Compare the before and after images to see if your HDR feature is working or not.</p><p>Such instances of Smart HDR may occur but you don’t need to worry too much about them. The simple solutions mentioned above will surely fix your problem. In case they don’t help, you can contact the Apple Support to get your queries resolved.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Video-Guide-HDR-on-your-iPhone-device"><a href="#Part-5-Video-Guide-HDR-on-your-iPhone-device" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Video Guide HDR on your iPhone device"></a>Part 5: Video Guide HDR on your iPhone device</h2><p>HDR photography is a really cool technique that can really make your content more appealing.

Let’s take a look at some of the best photo watermarking software products you can use in 2021.</p><h4 id="1-iWatermark-Pro"><a href="#1-iWatermark-Pro" class="headerlink" title="1. iWatermark Pro"></a>1. iWatermark Pro</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> $30</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows, iOS, Android</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iwatermark-pro-photo-watermark-software.jpg"                      alt="Photo watermark software Iwatermark Pro"                ></p><p>This cross-platform watermarking app can be used with image editors like Lightroom, ACDSee or Photoshop or as a standalone app. Furthermore, iWatermark Pro is compatible with a broad range of digital cameras, so you don’t have to worry about file formats, as the app lets you import or export photos in JPEG, PNG, TIFF or RAW file formats. The software’s list of watermarking features includes options like Signature, Arc Text, StegoMark or Metadata that enable you to add visible and invisible watermarks to your photos and videos. iWatermark also offers batch processing feature so that you can simultaneously add watermarks with the exact same settings to multiple images.</p><h4 id="2-uMark"><a href="#2-uMark" class="headerlink" title="2. uMark"></a>2. uMark</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free version available, $29 for a full version of the software</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS, iOS</p><p>There are different options of the software available, so you can opt for uMark Photo Watermarker if you’re only working with photos or you can use uMark Video Watermarker in case you often upload videos to the Internet. The app lets you use both text and images as watermarks on your photos, and it also offers powerful batch processing options that automate the process of watermarking large amounts of images. In addition to conventional watermarking options, uMark also lets you watermark your photos with QR codes or different shapes. You can easily customize all the watermarks you create with this software or save them if you want to use them on future projects.</p><h4 id="3-Arclab-Watermark-Studio"><a href="#3-Arclab-Watermark-Studio" class="headerlink" title="3. Arclab Watermark Studio"></a>3. Arclab Watermark Studio</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free version available, pricing plans start from $29 for a single computer license</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p><p>Even though the number of options Arclab’s Watermark Studio provides is somewhat underwhelming, the software still offers all the tools you need to customize your watermark. You can choose the font, the size of the text or adjust the opacity of each watermark you create with Arclab Watermark Studio and even use logos as watermarks. The option to add multiple watermarks to a single image is also available as well as the batch processing feature that lets you apply the same watermark to an unlimited number of pictures. The Arclab Watermark Studio is equipped with image resizing tools which makes it a perfect choice for photographers who often post their work on social media.</p><h4 id="4-TSR-Watermark-Image"><a href="#4-TSR-Watermark-Image" class="headerlink" title="4. TSR Watermark Image"></a>4. TSR Watermark Image</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, subscription plans start at $29.95</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS</p><p>Professional photographers who have previous experience with photo editing software, won’t need too much time to get used to TSR Watermark Image. Besides the basic text and image watermarking options, the software also offers the 3D watermark feature. The images that were taken with Canon, Sony, Nikon, and numerous other cameras can also be watermarked through metadata. The TSR Watermark Image app provides a rich selection of special effects, borders, and crosses that let you create stylish watermarks. The free version of this photo watermarking software offers only a limited amount of options and if you want to gain access to more than 200 fonts or advanced uploading features you must purchase one of the available subscription plans.</p><h4 id="5-Mass-Watermark"><a href="#5-Mass-Watermark" class="headerlink" title="5. Mass Watermark"></a>5. Mass Watermark</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, $30 for a lifetime license</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows</p><p>As its name suggests, Mass Watermark is designed to make the process of watermarking large quantities of photos quick and simple. In addition to powerful batch processing features this watermarking software for Mac and PC computers is equipped with Image Optimization tools that let you improve the overall quality of your photos before you apply a watermark to them. The app’s Watermark Designer lets you customize each watermark you create, while the Crop, Rotate and Resize features enable you to optimize your pictures for online use. What’s more, you can upload your photos to Flickr or your Picasa Web Album directly from Mass Watermark.</p><h4 id="6-Watermark-Software"><a href="#6-Watermark-Software" class="headerlink" title="6. Watermark Software"></a>6. Watermark Software</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, $24.90 for a lifetime license</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p><p>The fact that you can watermark up to 300 photos in just one minute with this photo watermarking software speaks volumes about its capabilities. In fact, you can watermark all your photos with Watermark Software in just three easy steps, since you just have to import the images to which you want to add a watermark, insert text or picture you’d like to use as a watermark and wait for the app to process them. The Watermark Tiling feature makes unauthorized usage of your work even more difficult, while the EXIF editor enables you to add watermarks to a photo’s metadata. The free version of the app offers only a limited number of features, and you must purchase the lifetime license if want to use all the watermarking tools this app has to offer.</p><h4 id="7-Alamoon-Watermark"><a href="#7-Alamoon-Watermark" class="headerlink" title="7. Alamoon Watermark"></a>7. Alamoon Watermark</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p><p>Despite being slightly outdated, Alamoon Watermark software is still a reliable option for all photographers who are looking for a simple way to add watermarks to their photos. This editor supports a broad range of photo file formats and it is capable of processing thousands of images in just a couple of minutes. However, it lacks advanced watermarking and photo editing tools, so enhancing the colors in a photo or creating watermark templates is not possible with Alamoon Watermark app. The professional version of this watermarking software is largely overpriced and there are more powerful and more affordable options available.</p><h4 id="8-Star-Watermark"><a href="#8-Star-Watermark" class="headerlink" title="8. Star Watermark"></a>8. Star Watermark</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free version available, pricing plans start at $17 for a lifetime license</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows</p><p>Customizing each watermark you create with this cross-platform app is a straightforward process that won’t take more than a few minutes of your time. You can easily alter the size of the text, change its color, add shadows or position the text anywhere in the photo. Star Watermark enables its users to use images as watermarks or even create multilayered watermarks. The batch processing features, however, remain one of the most common reasons why professional photographers opt to use the Star Watermark software. Unfortunately, the app doesn’t offer any of the advanced watermarking features, and it doesn’t allow you to use your digital signature as a watermark.</p><h4 id="9-Visual-Watermark"><a href="#9-Visual-Watermark" class="headerlink" title="9. Visual Watermark"></a>9. Visual Watermark</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, pricing plans start at $19.95 for a lifetime license</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows, Android</p><p>The Visual Watermark software makes watermarking hundreds of photos in a short period of time look easy. Besides watermarking photos, you can also use the Visual Watermark application to add watermarks to videos. There are 260 fonts available, but you can also import your own custom-made fonts and use them to create watermarks. The software adjusts the size and the position of the watermark to each photo automatically, but you can also fine-tune each of these settings manually. Most importantly, the Visual Watermark software protects your images from artificial intelligence algorithms that remove watermarks from photos automatically by making minor changes to the template you’re applying to the photos you’re processing.</p><h4 id="10-Water-Marquee"><a href="#10-Water-Marquee" class="headerlink" title="10. Water Marquee"></a>10. Water Marquee</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Web-based</p><p>This online watermarking tool enables you to create your own watermarks or use fully customizable templates to protect your images. The process of adding a watermark to a photo with Water Marquee is remarkably simple, as you just have to upload a photo to the platform and click on the Add Text, Add Logo or Use Template option. You can then proceed to insert the text, select its size, color or font and decide if you want to use a solid or transparent background. When done, simply click on the Save icon and choose the destination folder on your hard drive in which the watermarked photo is going to be stored.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>There is no way to control what happens to the photos you share on your website or on your social media accounts because people can share, repost or download them with a single click. The best way to reduce the chances of unsanctioned use of your work is to watermark all the pictures you share online. Which photo watermarking software do you use to copyright your photos?
