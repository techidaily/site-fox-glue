Tip 6: Use Blend IF"></a>6. Tip 6: Use Blend IF</h3><p>If you want to change the color of leaves on a tree, you can use the “Blend IF” option of Adobe Photoshop to precisely do the changes. Start with duplicating the existing layer and then hiding the second layer. Double click on the layer to open the menu and then use “Blend IF” sliders. This option works when you drag the sliders to black points, and it automatically hides the dark pixels of your photo.</p><p>Similarly, if you drag the “Blend IF” sliders towards white pints, it can hide the light pixels. To hide any specific color from the picture, you can click on “Channels” and then select the color you want to eradicate completely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/change-photo-color-9.jpg"                      alt="select the channel color"                ></p><p>This method only hides color based on their luminance values; however, this loads the entire layer when loading the active pixels. Regardless, this can be changed into transparency. For this, you need to select the layer by right-clicking and selecting the option of “Convert to Smart Object.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/change-photo-color-10.jpg"                      alt="convert to smart object"                ></p><p>It helps the user create transparency across the layer. After hiding the layer and coming back to another object-specific layer, you can create a certain change in effect through adjustment layers. For instance, you can create a “Hue and Saturation” adjustment layer. With the above settings, Photoshop applies this as a layer mask for you. Use the sliders across the set layer to change the color across the selected areas.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/change-photo-color-11.jpg"                      alt="select your new color"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118314/7443" target="_top" id="2118314">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118314" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118314/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-Tip-7-Use-Online-Photo-Editor-to-Change-Colors"><a href="#7-Tip-7-Use-Online-Photo-Editor-to-Change-Colors" class="headerlink" title="7.

Use <strong>Microsoft speech to text</strong> service. This service was launched in 2020 alongside the text-to-speech service, which includes famous computer-generated voices like <strong>Microsoft Sam</strong> and his brother, Mike. So, in this short read, you’ll learn what <strong>Microsoft Azure speech to text</strong> service is and its capabilities. I’ll also introduce you to the best Microsoft Azure STT alternatives. Let’s hunker down!</p><p><strong>Top Alternative to Microsoft Azure STT</strong> Save plenty of time on transcribing subtitles and boost your editing efficiency by applying Filmora Speech-To-Text.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try STT Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try STT Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Explore STT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Microsoft-Azure-and-Speech-Studio"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Microsoft-Azure-and-Speech-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Microsoft Azure and Speech Studio?"></a>Part 1: What is Microsoft Azure and Speech Studio?</h2><p>Microsoft Azure STT and TTS are part of <strong>Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech</strong>. These cognitive services feature state-of-the-art intelligence covering voice recognition, speaker recognition, machine translation, and OCR (Optical Character Recognition). The Microsoft speech to text service uses Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) to auto-recognize, analyze, and convert human voices to editable and searchable texts.</p><p>Having said that, Azure STT lets you transcribe streaming audio, microphone commentary, or local audio files. It supports 100+ languages, including English, German, French, Swahili, Hindi, Ukrainian, Turkish, Arabic, and more. Remember that this service also supports batch transcription, allowing you to transcribe multiple audios in batch.</p><p>In the meantime, Azure STT is available in many formats, including Speech SDK. Speech SDK (Software Development Kit) allows you to use popular programming languages to create a speech-enabled application. It’s compatible with Java, JavaScript, Python, Visual Studio C++, Swift, and Objective-C.</p><p>If you’re not good with programming languages, use Speech CLI, a command tool that allows you to use the speech recognition service without entering a code. Put simply, it features a minimal setup with precise requirements. Plus, it features pretty much everything you’ll find in Speech SDK. So, it depends on your skills and preference.</p><p>It is also worth noting that Azure Speech Studio supports keyword recognition or keyword spotting. You can generate keyword recognition models and specify any short phrase or word. Users can also personalize keywords with the correct punctuations. And best of all, there is no extra cost for customizing keywords.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Transcribe-Speech-to-Text-with-Microsoft-Speech-Studio"><a href="#Part-2-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Transcribe-Speech-to-Text-with-Microsoft-Speech-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Step by Step Guide to Transcribe Speech to Text with Microsoft Speech Studio"></a>Part 2: Step by Step Guide to Transcribe Speech to Text with Microsoft Speech Studio</h2><p>Now let’s learn how to use Microsoft Azure speech recognition services. Remember, the conversion may not be accurate if the audio has lots of domain-industry jargon or ambient noises. Therefore, use crisp-clear audio with an external mic or train the software to recognize specific words or keywords. Let’s get started!</p><p>Step1Start by creating a Microsoft Azure account. You’ll start with the free version, which gives you a <strong>$200 credit to use within 30 days</strong>. After depleting the free credits, use the pay-as-you-go model, which unlocks 40+ Azure services.</p><p>Step2After creating a Microsoft Azure portal, you’ll see all Azure services. Click the Speech Services tab or search for “speech services” on the search bar. Now click Create and then fill out the project details. Then, click Review and Create before clicking Create.</p><p>Step3The program will take a while to deploy an instance. Now tap Keys and endpoints on the left pane and copy the key and region identifier as you may need them later on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/microsoft-speech-to-text-1.jpg"                      alt="micrsoft azure speech to text copy key and region"                ></p><p>Step4Download and install Microsoft Visual C++ and .NET Core 3.1 Runtime. Next, install Speech CL on .NET by running this command “**dotnet tool install -global Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.CLI.**” Alternatively, download and install Speech CLI for Windows PCs as a <a class="link"   href="https://aka.ms/speech/spx-windows" >ZIP file <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Step5Now enter the Azure regional identifier and subscription key on Windows Terminal or PowerShell. To configure the region and key, run these commands; “<strong>spx config @key –set SUBSCRIPTION-KEY</strong> and **spx config @region –set REGION.**”</p><p>Step6Now it’s time to convert speech to text using Azure STT Service. To do that, run “<strong>spx recognize -microphone</strong>” on Terminal or PowerShell. Azure Speech CLI will listen to sound input and convert it to text.

Most of you may not be aware that Google Docs can accurately convert speech to text. This makes it a handy tool if you find speaking easier than writing. As expected, this voice transcription tool recognizes hundreds of languages, like English, French, Italian, Hindi, etc.</p><p>But although it does a commendable job, less-than-clear audio won’t give you accurate transcriptions. Also, it doesn’t feature niceties like periods, commas, and other punctuations. As such, stick to a professional app like Filmora to transcribe your audio to text.</p><p>Steps to convert voice to text with Google Docs:</p><p>Step1Open a new document on Google Docs and then click Voice typing. The inbuilt microphone will automatically launch.</p><p>Step2Next, click the language drop-down arrow on the microphone to choose the transcription language. You can dictate texts in English, Espanol, French, Italian, Afrikaans, Arabic, and more.</p><p>Step3Click the Microphone icon to start dictating texts on Google Docs. After dictating enough texts, tap the red Microphone icon and edit your text.

Whether it is a best romantic movie or a comedy genre, the trailer is one of the most fundamental things a production has to care about. Usually, the trailer consists of short clips from a movie to attract the audience to watch the whole movie. Confused about how to make a compelling trailer. No worries, today we will discuss in detail the <strong>best tips to make a fantastic movie trailer</strong>.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Best-4-tips-for-a-movie-trailer"><a href="#Part-1-Best-4-tips-for-a-movie-trailer" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Best 4 tips for a movie trailer"></a>Part 1. Best 4 tips for a movie trailer</h2><p>Here are a few essential tips to make a fantastic trailer that attracts viewers to watch your full movie.</p><h3 id="1-Choose-movie-footage"><a href="#1-Choose-movie-footage" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose movie footage"></a>1. Choose movie footage</h3><p>Selecting the movie footage is the first step in editing a trailer, which truly puts the viewer’s understanding and assessment of the film to the test. You need to quickly identify the movie’s main selling features and pick the most exciting content by watching the original film. These core selling points from the movie must immediately draw the audience’s attention to the movie.</p><p><strong>In choosing material, try to pay attention to</strong>:</p><p>First of all, you should choose the content that can represent the era and the subject matter of the movie. Secondly, pick images that show the protagonist’s personality and action-packed scenes. Finally, use as many of the major dramatic lines from the movie as you can, but also pay attention to the choice of shots; they should be longer than usual.</p><p><strong>In exploring the selling point or breaking point, try to start from</strong>:</p><h5 id="1-Movie-Type"><a href="#1-Movie-Type" class="headerlink" title="1. Movie Type"></a>1. Movie Type</h5><p>Find the core highlights in the movie according to its genre, then decide whether it’s a comedy, drama, or successful IP adaptation. For instance, comedies must have humorous components, whereas dramas may have complex character dynamics, etc. The trailer below shows the top action scenes of the footage indicating the movie type.</p><h5 id="2-Images-and-Scene"><a href="#2-Images-and-Scene" class="headerlink" title="2. Images and Scene"></a>2. Images and Scene</h5><p>Cool special effects in the movie, lovely or make a big impression on viewers; dazzling or filled with new things. Shots are intended to grab the attention of the viewer.</p><h5 id="3-Protagonist"><a href="#3-Protagonist" class="headerlink" title="3. Protagonist"></a>3. Protagonist</h5><p>It would help if you also kept an eye on the main character of your movie, the social value embodied by the identity of the characters in the movie, the relationship between the characters. And whether the movie stars artists with fan appeal or box office appeal in the movie.</p><h5 id="4-Director-awards"><a href="#4-Director-awards" class="headerlink" title="4. Director awards"></a>4. Director awards</h5><p>It’s the thing you’ve seen in almost every trailer, and you know why? Because it is a crucial breaking point of the whole movie. Moreover, it’s a great way to attract the viewer’s attention. So, you should also add the Director awards while editing the trailer. Widely regarded producers and directors have a special allure and selling point based on the “golden symbol” gathered by the producer’s or director’s work. The example trailer contains the Director’s most successful works as a reference.</p><h3 id="2-Structural-Design"><a href="#2-Structural-Design" class="headerlink" title="2. Structural Design"></a>2. Structural Design</h3><p>One of the main tips is structural design. While making a trailer, it’s not the only issue to select the matter; instead, the structure should also need attention. You should think about and create a structure of frames for your trailer.</p><p>The traditional trailer typically follows a three-act structure: the first act introduces the setting and main characters. The second act introduces the most exciting parts of the movie (such as jaw-dropping special effects scenes, intense action sequences, etc.). And the third act moves the second act’s elements toward the climax (such as an intense confrontation plot or suspenseful stagnation). It’s vital to keep in mind that the climax scene from the trailer is not always the same as the movie’s climactic scene—in fact, it almost isn’t. That explains why so many movies are terrible, but the trailers edit them to look good.</p><p>A well-structured trailer is more interesting to watch than one that’s not. Look at a well-structured trailer below.</p><h3 id="3-Subtitles"><a href="#3-Subtitles" class="headerlink" title="3. Subtitles"></a>3. Subtitles</h3><p>Subtitles are a great add-on to your trailer and can help broaden your audience as they help in more precise understanding and catch audiences from all over the world, not only from your region. If you don’t know how to handle it, we recommend using the simplest white text on a black background to set the subtitles apart from the background; if you want to add some of your own personality, start with elements like fonts, strokes, and shadows.

Among these, the selection of background music is an important step in the editing process since it helps to create the mood of the movie, portray the characters’ feelings, and improve the pace of the movie. One may say that the background music selection makes up more than 70% of a successful trailer.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139109/17108" target="_top" id="2139109">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139109" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139109/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-make-a-movie-trailer"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-make-a-movie-trailer" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Images and Scene"></a>2. Images and Scene</h5><p>Cool special effects in the movie, lovely or make a big impression on viewers; dazzling or filled with new things. Shots are intended to grab the attention of the viewer.</p><h5 id="3-Protagonist-1"><a href="#3-Protagonist-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Protagonist"></a>3. Protagonist</h5><p>It would help if you also kept an eye on the main character of your movie, the social value embodied by the identity of the characters in the movie, the relationship between the characters. And whether the movie stars artists with fan appeal or box office appeal in the movie.</p><h5 id="4-Director-awards-1"><a href="#4-Director-awards-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Director awards"></a>4. Director awards</h5><p>It’s the thing you’ve seen in almost every trailer, and you know why? Because it is a crucial breaking point of the whole movie. Moreover, it’s a great way to attract the viewer’s attention. So, you should also add the Director awards while editing the trailer. Widely regarded producers and directors have a special allure and selling point based on the “golden symbol” gathered by the producer’s or director’s work. The example trailer contains the Director’s most successful works as a reference.</p><h3 id="2-Structural-Design-1"><a href="#2-Structural-Design-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Structural Design"></a>2. Structural Design</h3><p>One of the main tips is structural design. While making a trailer, it’s not the only issue to select the matter; instead, the structure should also need attention. You should think about and create a structure of frames for your trailer.</p><p>The traditional trailer typically follows a three-act structure: the first act introduces the setting and main characters. The second act introduces the most exciting parts of the movie (such as jaw-dropping special effects scenes, intense action sequences, etc.). And the third act moves the second act’s elements toward the climax (such as an intense confrontation plot or suspenseful stagnation). It’s vital to keep in mind that the climax scene from the trailer is not always the same as the movie’s climactic scene—in fact, it almost isn’t. That explains why so many movies are terrible, but the trailers edit them to look good.</p><p>A well-structured trailer is more interesting to watch than one that’s not. Look at a well-structured trailer below.</p><h3 id="3-Subtitles-1"><a href="#3-Subtitles-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Subtitles"></a>3. Subtitles</h3><p>Subtitles are a great add-on to your trailer and can help broaden your audience as they help in more precise understanding and catch audiences from all over the world, not only from your region. If you don’t know how to handle it, we recommend using the simplest white text on a black background to set the subtitles apart from the background; if you want to add some of your own personality, start with elements like fonts, strokes, and shadows. You should set the appropriate subtitle style according to the style of the film. The most common types of subtitles used in trailers are closed caption and open caption.</p><p><strong>By type of subtitles</strong>:</p><p>Closed Caption:</p><p>The closed caption is the type of subtitle that allow a viewer to turn it on or off according to the need.

Music industry experts may create and edit dynamic audio tracks utilizing step-sequencing, multi-device editing, and live looping features with the help of the Logic Pro crossfades and full audio editing features it offers. Modern synthesizers, retro gear, and intricate multi-sampled instruments are just a few of the plugins and sounds that are included with Logic Pro X.</p><p>One of Apple’s hidden crown jewels for a number of years now has been the music creation program Logic Pro X. Logic Pro keeps becoming better and better. Fades make it easier to segue between different parts of a composition or between different track components. Audio and MIDI zones in the workspace may be faded in or out in a number of ways in Logic Pro X.

Audio can be in the form of dialogue, sound effects, or music.</li><li>Actors can play more than one role from moment to moment because only the voice needs to be changed.</li><li>Actors only use voice to express a character. They don’t need to use action, gestures, or facial expressions because the audience can’t see them.</li><li>There is no need for blocking or stage business in radio drama. However, actors may need to plan their movement to and from the microphone.</li><li>Radio playback can be set almost anywhere. There are no physical limits to overcome. Settings can easily be created with music and sound effects.</li><li>Radio drama contains a lot of dialogue. Since we can’t see what the actors are doing, they have to tell us what’s going on. The writer has to find ways for the characters to comment on where they are and what they and others are doing.</li><li>Radio scenes are often shorter than stage plays.</li><li>Radio drama must not be “live” in front of an audience. Radio drama is usually recorded and played back to an audience at a different time. This means that, just like in a movie, scenes don’t have to be played back-to-back and can be played more than once to get the best shot if needed. Drama can also be edited, and audio added.</li><li>Actors do not need to learn their lines. The actors can read their lines from the script because the audience can’t see it. Actors must be familiar with their lines and rehearsed how they will use their voice to tell the audience about the character and the action.</li><li>Radio drama usually features a small cast. A small number of characters are used in each scene because it is too difficult for the audience to distinguish between voices if there are many characters. The audience can also forget that a character is “on stage” if they don’t speak for a while because they can’t be seen. Because of this, the characters must speak quite often and be involved in the plot.</li><li>Radio drama is well suited for monologue and for plays where the setting is limited and physical action is not important, such as in a prison cell or cave.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-3-tips-for-writing-radio-drama-scripts"><a href="#Part-2-3-tips-for-writing-radio-drama-scripts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 tips for writing radio drama scripts"></a>Part 2. 3 tips for writing radio drama scripts</h2><p>Scriptwriting is a fundamental technique of creativity, whether for content production, copywriting, or art direction. Florida International University offers the Master of Science Creative Track in collaboration with the world-renowned portfolio school Miami Ad School. If you want to become a copywriter, the program is designed to hone your writing skills for a variety of communication styles and media, such as writing for video and audio content, TV and radio commercials, and the web.</p><p>Here are some tips to become a better audio-only content writer.</p><p>Writing a script allows you to control the content, structure, and flow of the program. If the show is unscripted and organic, the host will have talking points for reference. In addition to the script, you can also play with music and sound effects.</p><h3 id="1-Keep-your-scripts-clear"><a href="#1-Keep-your-scripts-clear" class="headerlink" title="1. Keep your scripts clear"></a>1. Keep your scripts clear</h3><p>Write the script while keeping it as simple as possible. Don’t fill your sentences with words that don’t add to what you’re trying to say.</p><p>Reading from a script can make you sound a little unnatural, as well as stiff and robotic. That is a huge error. When read aloud, the script should sound natural. A more formal approach and style can result in a show that sounds unnatural and is boring.</p><p>Radio has long been a popular form of entertainment, and radio dramas or plays are an excellent way for writers to express themselves. Original stories or adaptations of novels or plays can be used in radio dramas. Radio plays, like stage plays, have scenes, sequences, and acts, but they are not always structured the same way. Radio drama allows for a great deal of flexibility and creativity, and the medium of sound is also unique.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/radio-drama-scripts-2.jpg"                      alt="keep your scripts clear"                ></p><p>Novelists and screenwriters will need to alter their writing style to write for the ear rather than the eye. Listeners cannot read the previous line or skip ahead. Everything must make sense and be visualized by the listener at that time. To convey action and drama, use dialogue, sound effects, music, and even silence. This can be completed by including specific audio cues in your script so that the show’s creators understand your vision. Keep the script as brief as possible. There can never be too much prose or long-winded dialogue in radio plays. Everything must be brief, succinct, and to the point.</p><h3 id="2-Jump-right-into-the-action"><a href="#2-Jump-right-into-the-action" class="headerlink" title="2. Jump right into the action"></a>2. Jump right into the action</h3><p>Radio drama can be more difficult because it must immediately engage listeners, or they will lose interest and switch stations or channels. The first two minutes are crucial, so start your drama at the appropriate point in the story. The rule of thumb in the radio industry is ‘arrive late, leave early.’ This means you should enter the story at a later stage when the action has begun or when a crisis has occurred. Unlike books and movies, setting, building, and background details are not required. You can save the necessary details for later in the play.</p><p>Radio scripts, like scripts, must conform to industry standards for radio program producers to find the script usable. Include scripts for music, sound effects, silence, dialogue, and other audio needs in the game so that producers can see how the script will translate into the show. Include information for the actors as well, so they can bring your vision to life. For example, use adjectives to describe how they should sound when reading their lines - sad, angry, laughing, and so on. Also, keep the number of characters to a minimum and give each one a distinct voice and style.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/radio-drama-scripts-3.jpg"                      alt="jump right into the action"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977032">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977032.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977032">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977032.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977032%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977032/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123511/26400" target="_top" id="2123511">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2123511" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123511/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Make-It-Sound-Conversational"><a href="#3-Make-It-Sound-Conversational" class="headerlink" title="3.

But the big question is ‘If your audience doesn’t turn on the sound of your videos, how do they get the message you’re trying to pass?” Well, this is why adding ‘Subtitles’ to your videos is crucial. However, for a subtitle to work, it needs to comply with the structure of a video player or any platform you intend to use it on. And fortunately, SRT is a universal format, making it usable on any social media platform.</p><p>In this guide, you’ll be introduced to the simple methods you can utilize to upload SRT files to social media platforms including YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, etc. But before we proceed, let’s take a look at an overview of the different social media platforms and the subtitle file formats they support.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Social Media Platform</th><th>SRT</th><th>VTT</th><th>STL</th><th>SSA</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>YouTube</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Instagram</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Vimeo</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>LinkedIn</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>From the overview table above, it’s obvious you can easily create one SRT file and easily use it on different social media channels. This saves you the stress of creating different subtitle files for each platform. So, without further ado, let’s dive in to find out how to upload and add .srt files to different social media platforms.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Upload-SRT-Files-to-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-Upload-SRT-Files-to-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Upload SRT Files to YouTube Videos"></a>Part 1: Upload SRT Files to YouTube Videos</h2><p>If you’re a YouTube video content creator, but you still don’t know the benefit of adding subtitles to your videos, let’s give you the top two main hints on how subtitles affect your videos;</p><ul><li>Subtitles help your videos to be understood not only by folks who hear and see but also by folks who have hearing problems. Hence helping your video to reach more audience.</li><li>You need subtitles to make your videos SEO rich as phrases in your subtitle can be used as keywords by Google when users search for stuff related to your video online.</li></ul><p>That being said, keep in mind that SRT subtitles and CC are two different things. Although they are often used interchangeably, they are both distinct. The only similarity CC and SRT share is that they’re text version of the audio aspect of videos.</p><p>CC, also known as Close Caption the words spoken in the video, and it allows viewers understand the information being passed in a video without necessarily turning on the volume.</p><p>SRT subtitles, on the other hand, are translations of the word that’s spoken in a video. For example, if you’re streaming Korean movie, but you don’t understand the language, you’d need a translation of the dialogue at the bottom of your screen. The English translation that’s displayed on your screen is known as the SRT subtitles.</p><p>Now you know how subtitles affect your videos, and what the difference between SRT and CC are, let’s proceed to learn how to upload SRT files to YouTube videos.</p><p>Step1Sign in to your YouTube channel and locate the ‘YouTube Creator Studio’. Then select ‘Subtitles’ on the right menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-upload-srt-file-to-youtube-video-1.jpg"                      alt="subtitles"                ></p><p>Step2Select the Video that you want to add SRT to.

This made uploading SRT to tweet very straightforward. All you just have to do is to compose a tweet with your video then use the “Upload Caption File (.srt)” option to upload the SRT file.

Frame rate is the frequency at which frames or images are recorded or displayed. You have to consider shooting frame rate and displaying frame rate for videography. For slow-motion videos, the shooting frame rate should be higher than the displaying frame rate. The displaying frame rate generally stays fixed for any video project.</p><p>The shooting frame rate determines how slow your video will look. If you shoot at 120 frames per second(fps) and display it at 30 fps, the video will play at 4 times slower. If you shoot at 480 fps, you are primarily shooting for super slow motion videos. We will explain all the different shooting frame rates for slow motion and state the best situations to use them.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-60-fps"><a href="#1-60-fps" class="headerlink" title="1. 60 fps"></a>1. 60 fps</h2><p>Anything higher than 30 fps is for creating slow-motion videos. 60 fps is the standard slow motion frame rate for Hollywood movies. You must have come across scenes where the superhero walks out slowly in a dramatic manner. Such scenes are shot at 60fps and displayed at 24 or 30 fps. Besides, this frame rate is suitable for capturing character’s emotions as well.</p><p>Basically, you should use 60 fps when the action is already slow. Some examples are someone walking out of an action sequence, blowing off candles, or getting dressed. Shooting video at 60fps enhances the smoothness of the action. The visuals look more detailed and real. That is why people shoot 4K videos at 60fps.</p><p>Best Situation - When you are shooting slow-motion video for any action that is already slow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/60-fps-for-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="60 fps slow motion video"                ></p><h2 id="2-120-fps"><a href="#2-120-fps" class="headerlink" title="2. 120 fps"></a>2. 120 fps</h2><p>Let us assume that you are shooting at 120 fps and displaying at 30 fps. The video will play 4 times slower than it is in real life. The slow-motion effect will be two times slower than shooting at 60fps. If you shoot slow action at 120 fps, the output will be unusually slow and visually unpleasant. Therefore, you should shoot fast action scenes at 120 fps.</p><p>Some of the examples are someone running, playing slow sports, or drifting a car. You will find professionals using 120 fps for showing the slow-motion football kick and baseball bat swing. The scene will come out super smooth and visually crisp. 120 fps is widely used in the gaming industry for fast-paced action games.</p><p>Best Situation - When you are shooting slow-motion video for fast-paced action and fast moving subjects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/120-fps-for-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="120 fps slow motion"                ></p><h2 id="3-180-fps"><a href="#3-180-fps" class="headerlink" title="3. 180 fps"></a>3. 180 fps</h2><p>The scenes that are suitable for 120 fps are also suitable for 180 fps. This means you can shoot fast-moving subjects, objects, and elements. Some of the examples are horse riding, subject running, riding a bike, and likewise. But when you shoot at 180 fps, your objective is to show down the action much further.</p><p>This means that a scene shot at 180 fps will look slower than at 120 fps. You must have seen scenes where an object in motion is slowed down and zoomed in for detail. Such scenes are perfect for 180 frame rate. You may not achieve super slow mow scenes but it is going to be somewhere near that.</p><p>Best Situation - When you are shooting slow-motion video for fast moving action with emphasis on slow downing motion further.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/180-fps-for-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="180 fps slow motion"                ></p><h2 id="4-240-fps"><a href="#4-240-fps" class="headerlink" title="4. 240 fps"></a>4. 240 fps</h2><p>When you are capturing an action that is too fast for your eyes to see, you should use 240 fps. For example, when you are watching a fast-paced sports event, your eyes cannot capture all movements. When you capture those scenes at 240 fps, the output video will look more comfortable for the eyes. The use of 240 fps is very popular in sports like cricket.</p><p>The broadcasters show replays in slow motion by capturing bat and ball strikes at 240 fps. You will also come across videos like slow mow water splashes that are shot at 240 fps. In action movies, you can see the hero punching the villain in the face. Then the scene shows the impact of the punch on the face with skin and muscle getting shattered. Such scenes are perfectly shot at 240 fps.</p><p>Best Situation - When you are shooting slow-motion video for action that are too fast for the eyes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/240-fps-for-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="240 fps slow motion video"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134496/18498" target="_top" id="2134496">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134496" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134496/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-480-fps"><a href="#5-480-fps" class="headerlink" title="5. 480 fps"></a>5. 480 fps</h2><p>If you want super slow motion video, you have to shoot at 480 fps. The 480 frame rate is considered to be the base of super slow motion. There are higher frame rates available for more enhanced super slow-motion videos. When you shoot at 480 fps, the video will play 16 times slower. This is usual in showcasing extremely fast movements.</p><p>For example, when you are shooting with a gun, the bullet goes out at lightning speed. You will need 480 fps to capture the scene of the bullet coming out of the gun and show it in extremely slow motion. Some other scenarios are slicing a vegetable with a knife, dropping a water-filled balloon on the floor, or performing skateboard skills. All such scenarios should be shot at 480 fps for super slow video output.</p><p>Best Situation - When you are shooting extremely fast actions and show in super slow motion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/480-fps-for-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="480 fps slow motion"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1521325/16446" target="_top" id="1521325">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1521325" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1521325/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There is no definite answer to which is the best frame rate for slow motion. It completely depends on what you are shooting. Yes, it is true that 60 fps is the standard slow motion fps. But 60 fps is only suitable when the action is low as well. Different frame rates are suitable for different scenes. The faster the action you are shooting, the higher should be the frame rate. For smooth super slow motion video, you should consider shooting at 480 fps. Frame rate beyond 480 is suitable for capturing slow-motion explosion videos.</p><p>Frame rate is an extremely important parameter in videography. Frame rate is the frequency at which frames or images are recorded or displayed. You have to consider shooting frame rate and displaying frame rate for videography. For slow-motion videos, the shooting frame rate should be higher than the displaying frame rate. The displaying frame rate generally stays fixed for any video project.</p><p>The shooting frame rate determines how slow your video will look. If you shoot at 120 frames per second(fps) and display it at 30 fps, the video will play at 4 times slower. If you shoot at 480 fps, you are primarily shooting for super slow motion videos.

Copyright of Free Meme Templates</strong></p><p>Like every other type of content that you may see online, memes (even free meme templates) are copyrighted. But the reason you don’t hear about this is that meme copyright infringement is rarely enforced. Memes are relatively easy to create and cost next to nothing so pursuing litigation in copyright infringement may not be worth the cost. They are also widely available and it is difficult to figure out where they originated from.</p><p>If you are worried about the legal implications of using a free meme template, you can credit the creator of the meme whenever you use it. But because it can often be difficult to find out who created the meme, this may be very difficult. The only way to overcome these legal challenges may be to use some of the meme templates on this page to create your own meme that will be unique to you.</p><p><strong>2.

The quality appears blown out during the import process. This happens due to incompatibility issues with the Smart HDR feature in iPhone 12 series devices, which cannot work on older models.</p><p>There are particular ways in which it is possible to rectify the <strong>iPhone 12 HDR video</strong> quality issue. In this article, we discuss that further.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Dolby-Vision-HDR-Video-in-iPhone-12-or-13"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Dolby-Vision-HDR-Video-in-iPhone-12-or-13" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Dolby Vision HDR Video in iPhone 12 or 13"></a>Part 1: What is Dolby Vision HDR Video in iPhone 12 or 13</h2><p>Before we start discussing how to fix the <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> problem at hand, one should understand what Dolby Vision HDR means in the first place. To note, it is a proprietary type of HDR format, with more data than SDR videos. This is because the camera quality with HDR effect can capture video recordings with extra data regarding the scenes, like shadows, highlights, and color range.</p><p>Moreover, the Dolby Vision type of <strong>HDR video iPhone 12</strong> feature works with dynamic metadata, which is useful for tone-mapping images in frame-to-frame or scene-by-scene format. The iPhone 12 devices allow the user to shoot high-quality Dolby Vision HDR videos in 4K, at 30-60 FPS. That is possible with the support of extra RAM in these device models and the presence of the A14 Bionic system-on-chip. Not to mention, iPhone 12 models come with a 10-bit OLED display.</p><p>Such factors make the demand for Dolby Vision <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> settings reasonable. However, the Dolby Vision quality only works on the most compatible devices with relevant display types. At this point, iPhone 12 is the only phone with this feature in the camera, which limits the ability to share 10-bit HDR videos to other devices or platforms, like Adobe Premiere Pro.</p><p>Having HDR-based video playing in the SDR display type would automatically make the colors look weird and washed out. If the software came with an SDR squash functionality for importing&#x2F;exporting Dolby Vision HDR videos in SDR format, that would benefit users.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-the-HDR-videos-on-iPhone-look-washed-out-or-overexposed"><a href="#Part-2-Why-the-HDR-videos-on-iPhone-look-washed-out-or-overexposed" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why the HDR videos on iPhone look washed out or overexposed?"></a>Part 2: Why the HDR videos on iPhone look washed out or overexposed?</h2><p>It is inaccurate to assume that the <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> issues like overexposure or washed-out appearance occur due to Adobe Premiere not supporting Dolby HDR. On the other hand, the more reasonable reason is that most of the screens and system versions do not work with this functionality.</p><p>So, even if you use the Premiere Pro software and import exact images with accurate color composition and resolution, the image quality might look bad on most devices. If a monitor supports the HDR quality and you choose the relevant color space, overexposure issues will be limited.</p><p>Therefore, there is a need to click the video with the <strong>HDR video camera</strong> and display it on the right platform&#x2F;screen. In Premiere Pro, the Override into Rec.709 solution is available and can work to rectify this issue for some users.</p><p>With the right features like Color Workspace, Lumetri pre-sets, and other features, you can add them in a drag-and-drop manner to work on the project pane for more customizations.</p><p>The Premiere Pro 2022 version can work with the video clips as HDR after changing specific CM settings. The right monitoring setup must be prepared while working on this editing environment.</p><p>Also, it is important to consider the nits’ levels on screens to understand if a device can even display the <strong>iPhone 12 HDR video.</strong> These devices support a 10-bit OLED display type that can reach a peak brightness of 1200 nits. So, it is suitable to showcase the footage without much error.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Most-Effective-4-Ways-to-Fix-Overexposed-iPhone-HDR-video-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part-3-Most-Effective-4-Ways-to-Fix-Overexposed-iPhone-HDR-video-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Most Effective 4 Ways to Fix Overexposed iPhone HDR video in Premiere Pro"></a>Part 3: Most Effective 4 Ways to Fix Overexposed iPhone HDR video in Premiere Pro</h2><p>The following are some of the feasible solutions we’ve gathered, you can take to handle the overexposure quality of HDR videos while using Premiere Pro.</p><h3 id="Solution-1-Turn-Off-HDR-or-Export-them-without-HDR"><a href="#Solution-1-Turn-Off-HDR-or-Export-them-without-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Solution 1: Turn Off HDR or Export them without HDR"></a>Solution 1: Turn Off HDR or Export them without HDR</h3><p>One of the easiest methods to avoid issues with <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> is to switch off the HDR setting directly.
