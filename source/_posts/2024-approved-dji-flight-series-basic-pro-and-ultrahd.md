 Same as Phantom 3 Advanced unit, the professional one possesses Lightbridge ability along with highly improved GPS system and 720p video feed. But you will be glad to know that it also offers 4k recording ability. The only difference among all previous models and professional one is that this unit comes with a big 100W charger that can complete full charging within one hour; whereas all other units use to consume 1.20 hours for full charging.

## Conclusion

 All Phantom models are well designed and offer great features as per their price point. They focus on needs of regular users as well as on professional requirements. So we can say that none of these is a bad choice. If you are ready to buy a drone for your flight experience then it is important to make a list of all features and specifications first that you want to enjoy during your flights. Also have a look on your budget or savings. Then go for detailed comparison between these available phantom products and soon you will be able to choose the best drone unit for yourself.

 Let me remind you that, all these four models are equipped with GPS position hold feature, point of interest ability, follow me mode, waypoints, home lock, course lock, real time battery monitoring facility and the return to home feature. Further all of them offer flight time estimation feature, stabilized videos and photos along with manual camera exposure control.
