## What is a webcam recording?

A webcam is a small, easy-to-use camera plugged into your computer to allow you to see yourself in real time. These days, most computers have built-in webcams, so one of the easiest ways to start recording video is to use a webcam.

![podcast camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/best-webcam-for-podcast-1.jpg)

Webcams are inexpensive, easy to set up, and usually already come pre-loaded with software that will allow you to record video and audio for your podcast.

## What to expect from a webcam for podcasting?

Adding video to your podcasts can help them stand out. However, just like with other forms of webcasting, there's no guarantee that you will have the best audio quality out of the box. Here are four things you can expect from your webcam when doing a podcast:

### (1) Field of view

It's essential to keep the field of view (FOV) wide enough so obstacles do not block the camera, even if those obstructions are large. On the other hand, if the FOV is too narrow, the camera may be unable to capture all of the scenery in front of it, thus missing key elements of your shot. Also, a wider FOV will produce a more dramatic picture and give your audience a better sense of the setting.

### (2) Picture quality

The quality of a webcam will determine how much it can be used for video-conferencing, recording video and audio, and live-streaming events. The quality of a webcam is defined by its resolution (the higher, the better), frame rate, dynamic range, and noise levels. The resolution of a webcam is measured in pixels per inch. High-resolution webcams have 1280 x 720-pixel resolution, while lower-quality ones have 640 x 480 resolution.

### (3) Companion software

Most webcams include a companion app or downloadable software that will make them even more versatile and powerful. The final product will look much better. You can add your music to your videos, text your podcasts and other media, or edit and remix your audio and video recordings using the editing features. And you know what the most exciting part about webcam companion software is? That the downloading is free of cost.

## Hot FAQs on Best Webcams for Podcast

### 1\. Is my laptop's camera good enough for podcasting?

Every laptop webcam will do for a podcast, but not all laptops have the same capabilities. A good quality webcam can capture high-definition (HD) video at up to 30 frames per second (fps). That is necessary for high-end applications, such as recording software and Skype. If the laptop's webcam supports the same or better features, then it's good to go for a podcast.

### 2\. Is high-definition necessary?

Today, many webcam manufacturers have introduced high-definition Webcams that offer a higher quality of video capture, which is worth considering. But if you're looking for high definition, you need to understand two things

First, you must consider the type of content you produce. For example, do you primarily create video podcasts? In this case, a higher-quality webcam makes sense. But if you're recording a book or a live event, a lower-quality webcam may be all you need.

### 3\. Are webcams good for podcasting?

Webcams are said to be perfect for podcasting.

Here are some reasons:

* Webcams come with very inexpensive microphones.
* It's easy to capture sound waves from all around you.
* There are many options for editing sound files after you've captured them, including Audacity, Audacity Studio, and Windows Live Movie Maker.
* Your image quality won't have to suffer.
