 The gaming world is fast evolving in line with every gamers crave for a better gaming experience. As a matter of fact, there is a new technology in town i.e the 4k resolution also called Ultra HD which has entered the gaming world. The 4k resolution is supported by graphic cards which are not just up to date but also designed for this technology.

 Well, 4k resolution can be achieved by the use of good graphics card which we will look at later in depth. These graphic cards are expensive although there are surely others that are relatively cheap. Some gamers have even opted to use double graphic cards in a bid to try to achieve this resolution. This may work although in other instances it has failed to work as it is incompatible with machines that do not to support multiple cards. So if you are looking for the best graphic cards for 4K gaming then we have compiled a great list for you!

 **Pros**

* It is cheap @ $489
* Good performance within the budget range

 **Cons**

* Noisy during usage
* Doesn't support a lot of 4k resolution games

#### 4.**AMD RADEON RX 570**

 This GPU is quite good for a budget client being the cheapest in the range. It is based on Polaris architecture with overclocking core.

 **Pros**

* It is known to be a high dynamic range content meaning the contrast in colors always come out with a high resolution
* It has a double fan that ensures cooling is well taken care of
* It has a free sync technology that allows it to adjust the refresh rate to that of the frame rate being outputted by the graphic card this reduces screen tearing and stuttering.
* The cross fire allows the same GPU be installed and the processes be split hence increasing efficiency and resolution

### Conclusion

 The gaming industry has been moving with the times allowing better resolution, faster games and achieving a virtual reality in HD as well as in 3D. With the graphics we have looked at we have been able to establish that this technology is driven by price, performance and the ability of the computer being used.

 From more expensive GPU to the budget ones we have to establish that users are interested in a better resolution that can achieve virtual reality with speed. Users are also interested in GPU devices that don't overheat as well as well as those that are compatible with the computer they plan to use. This technology will always be changing with the times so it is important to always buy one that gives value for money, versatile and bound to work for long.
