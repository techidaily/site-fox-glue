## Things to Consider When Choosing 4K Color Grading Monitors

4K monitors are loaded with many specifications and features, and we have explained in details about [how to choose a right 4K monitor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). But if you need a product for your color grading needs, then it is essential to go through the three major things below:

**_Gamut and Gamma:_** It deals with the complete range of colors as well as Luma capabilities to ensure accurate display. Currently, the most popular one is Adobe RGB whereas some monitors are designed with DCI-P3 and Rec 709 or 2020 rating.

**_Black Levels:_** Colorists always need deep black details without those muddy greys that are always annoying. This setting leaves major impact on contrast.

**_Calibration:_** Professionals need to calibrate their monitor for different applications and it can be done with built in tools, dedicated software or using external probe. A good quality monitor offers better customization options for calibration.
