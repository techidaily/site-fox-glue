 From last so many years, Garmin is competing [GoPro](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) with its ultimate technological combinations in camera design. The VIRB Ultra 30, the latest action camera from Garmin, is the most competitive action camera unit with resolution up to [4K](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) level same as that of GoPro. Although the image quality was not yet grown up GoPro level but all other features were impressive and well designed. It features advanced voice control, straight forward interface and electronic image stabilization along with attractive hardware design. VIRB Ultra 30 is able to record various data aspects such as movements, speed and other ratings from fitness tracker etc. To get a Garmin camera with all these features, users need to pay $399.99 only.

#### Design

![garmin-virb-ultra-30-design](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/garmin-virb-ultra-30-design.jpg)

 The earlier models of Garmin were limited to monochrome screen displays but this time product developers have copied GoPro in impressive manner. VIRB Ultra 30 has been developed with colour LCD screen that can assist users in live preview. The overall dimension of touch screen is 1.75 inch where you can access all photo and video setting icons so easily. But the sad news is that Garmin Ultra 30 is not useful for underwater applications without additional housing. The effective size of Ultra 30 with protective case goes up to 2.3x3.1x1.3 inches whereas overall weight increases up to 5.5 ounces. You can go up to 131 feet under water with this case.
