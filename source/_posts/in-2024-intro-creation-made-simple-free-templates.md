## Intro Creation Made Simple - Free Templates

Video intros are important in videography because viewers first see a video intro before the main video. You may lose viewers if the video intro is not attractive enough to make them stay on your page or YouTube channel. Almost everyone needs visual content, especially a business owner or YouTuber. Learning about the two main categories of **video intro makers** gives you total control of your visual contents, irrespective of your need for the software. For example, you will learn about the uniqueness of editable and not editable free **video intro templates**. Read on and figure out how you may use individual video intro makers.

## Part 1: Free video intro templates (Editable)

All the individual video intro templates are free to use but offer significant features that differentiate them from one another. Learning about these features and using them in your projects enhance productivity and utility. Then we will introduce some customizable video intro templates, which users can change according to their style and creativity to show their personality better. Some editable video intro makers need software for editing; others are free without a corresponding editor, and you can edit it online. Some essential intro makers include:

### 1\. [**Filmstock**](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/)

[Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the editor for Filmstock.

Filmstock supports GIF – aside from the video compilation, you can exploit the GIF support since it includes a 4K resolution editing option. The GIF, video stabilization, and 4K resolution make Filmstock stand out in the competition. Other significant features include split-screen, multiple video clips, color grading, and video controls.
