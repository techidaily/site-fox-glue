Auto track cameras, simply put, are cameras that detect your presence and follow your movements.

The feature was introduced as the world’s inclination towards digital content grew. Designed using the video analysis technology, tracing moving objects in high resolution vides developed as a feature to make video shooting extremely convenient.

Whether you’re a vlogger seeking solo fun and adventure or a lecturer trying newer mediums to reach out to a greater audience, a face-tracking camera will free your hands so that you can focus your attention on what you’re good at.

There are several such auto-track cameras that you will find floating around the internet. Through this blog, we bring to you the most sought after ones in three different segments.

## Best Auto Facial Tracking Cameras for Vlog

Let’s take a look at the top auto facial tracking cameras you can buy with your money.

### 1\. OBSBOT Tail

A sleek and highly stable solution to face-tracking, [OBSBOT Tail](https://www.obsbot.com/obsbot-tail-ai-camera) ranks high for its superior build, high-standard parameters, and cool specifications.

### Frequently Asked Questions About Auto-Tracking Camera

1. **Why Would I Need An Auto Tracking Camera?**

There’s literally so much you can achieve with the help of an auto track camera, from precision to consistency. It really doesn’t matter what kind of use you put a camera -- creative shots, hands-free convenience, or stationary surveillance. For shots that require slow motion, time-lapses, or simply capturing movement, handling tripods are way too much hassle. And when the times (and shots) are too rocky, they’re just not enough to stabilize and focus.

For times when you’re on a tight budget or with no room for extra equipment, or if you simply aren’t well versed with complex camera functions but love to shoot, the auto-track camera gives way to your creativity to shine.

1. **What Is The Price Of A Tracking Camera?**

The price of an auto track camera can widely vary according to the features, quality, brand, and additional accessories that you are looking for. On the lower end, you can get a face-tracking camera for $400\. At this low price, you may get a decent camera that auto tracks, but it may also mean a compromise on durability, sensor precision, resolution, and quality, among other things.

On the higher end, with loaded features, high resolution, flexibility in lenses, sound audio recording, you can expect the price to range between one to a few grand easily.

1. **Where To Buy An Auto Tracking Camera For Sports?**

It is easy to purchase an auto-tracking camera for sports, thanks to the convenience of online shopping. You can find most of these cameras on sites like Amazon at the standard price set by the manufacturer. Also, there is the official company’s e-commerce page and more affiliate blogs and vendors that you can shop from. If you want to physically buy, you can get them at your nearest electronics showrooms.

To sum it up, when buying an auto track camera, always consider your needs and uses. Each camera specializes in meeting a set of performance expectations. For instance, vlogging needs better resolution, conferences need more precision, and sports need more movement flexibility. Once you have your priorities sorted, this guide is exhaustive to help you with your buying decision.
