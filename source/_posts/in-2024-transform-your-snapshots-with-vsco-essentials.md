### 1\. Makes Adjustments

Before starting with editing your picture, the first rule is to crop the picture by making appropriate pictures. Make sure that the angle of your photo is correct and straight by removing the unwanted edges and objects from the frame. Your subject should be at the center so that it can instantly catch a viewer's attention. You can do this entire process manually or automatically on the VSCO Photo Editor.

### 2\. Control the Light Exposure

Light exposure is the other significant element of the picture as a perfect light exposure draws attention and seems pleasant to the eyes. Many times, individuals capture photos in daylight or in a room where the light exposure is minimum. If your subject is not illuminated perfectly, you can effectively control the light exposure through the VSCO Photo Editor.

### 3\. Adjust the White Balance

White balancing is another technique through which you can enhance the colors present in your picture. VSCO Photo Editor has this advanced function through which you can increase the temperature of the image by highlighting the colors, or you can add a tint to make the colors softer.

### 7\. Control the Saturation

Saturation in photography means controlling the sharpness and intensity of the colors. If you have captured a faded color photo, you increase its intensity by enhancing its saturation. As a result, the human eye will automatically give attention to the color details in your picture.
