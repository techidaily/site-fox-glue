 Mar 27, 2024â€¢ Proven solutions

Creating picture-in-picture videos can be one of the best ways that you can make reaction videos or play-by-play videos showcasing yourself on camera as well as action happening in the main video.

This type of video has become extremely popular on YouTube and other video sharing websites. If you are interested in breaking into this medium, it becomes much easier with the help of the macOS Sierra update. Through the improvements with this new operating system and extremely high demand for picture-in-picture videos, users are finding it much simpler to create this style of video.

In order to create professional picture-in-picture videos, you're going to need access to an editing suite. Having a professional **PIP video editor** can be one of the best ways to edit together a picture-in-picture video and add in some of your own effects in the process.

## How to make a picture-in-picture video on Mac OS Sierra

One of the best picture-in-picture video editors available on mac OS sierra right now is [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Here are the detailed steps for creating a PIP(picture-in-picture) video with Filmora:

### Step 1 Download and Install Wondershare Filmora

To get started, locate an area that you can download the Wondershare Filmora program. The free editing software is available from the Wondershare website, as well as throughout several other spots online.

Getting your hands on the software is the easiest part, and installing the software takes just a few moments. You can use the free version of Filmora or unlock all of the features of the program by paying for the full licensed version of the software.

### Step 2 Import video files

![create pip video on macos sierra](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/active/picture-in-picture-steps.png)

After you have installed the full version or trial version of the program, you just need to import the video files that you would like to use.

Think of two videos that you would like to play at the same time in a picture-in-picture format and then import both video files to the editor.

Once the two files have been added to the software, you can manipulate them however you see fit.

### Step 3 Modify PIP track

To get a PIP video, double click on the added video or image on the PIP track. The Motion panel will open. Click the "Advanced" button for extra Mask and Effect options.

Choose a motion effect you like to make Picture-in-Picture video/images. There will be a sign when motion is added to a PIP. You can put the Picture-in-Picture video/images in any position you want.

![move picture in picture](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/move-pip.jpg)

Once you are comfortable with the viewing area that you would like to playback, put the videos on top of each other in a picture-in-picture style, and have them play at the same time.

This picture-in-picture format is like a video overlay, and you can take out the area where the second video will play and sync it up with the main video too.

Once you are comfortable with how the videos play in relation to each other, where the video tracks are located and more, you can work at saving the film.

### Step 4 Saving and sharing

Wondershare Filmora makes the process of saving much easier because there are so many files available for output. With a massive amount of video output tools and track options, you can pick options like the optimal resolution for your video, the best sound options, and more.

You can also find upload tools or DVD burning tools available all within the Filmora editor, making the process of sharing your video much easier as well.

If you are looking for the easiest way to create picture-in-picture video experiences on the new Mac OS sierra, you have got to try Wondershare Filmora.
