## Part 2: FAQ for Camcorder

### 1\. Is it worth buying a camcorder?

One of the biggest reasons for buying camcorders is the lens. With DSLRs and mirrorless cameras coming to the forefront, people doubt the credibility of a camcorder. But camcorders have powerful and long zoom lenses with tiny imaging sensors, which makes it more powerful than any DSLR. It also comes with variable speed zoom control that can create smooth, slow zooms to reveal and introduce a location, or quick punch-ins to highlight the action. There are no limits in recording time with camcorders, which makes it ideal for event photography. Camcorders can be plugged into the socket to continue with videography when batteries are exhausted and have dedicated dials for adjusting volume levels.

### 3\. Can GoPro replace camcorder?

Replacing camcorders is not a matter of joke. Every tool has its credibility that remains unmatched in some respects. For a hands-free point of view recording, the [GoPro cameras are great](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/video/tips-and-solutions/tips-using-gopro-cameras-video-production). For professional and advanced level, the manual controls of GoPro can become a big problem. There are also a lack of buttons like shutter speed, aperture, etc. in GoPro, which makes it suitable only for timer setting shoots where you don’t need to adjust on the fly.

Another aspect where the camcorders wins the brownies is the image quality. The long built-in zoom and tiny sensors in the camcorders offer a variety of perspectives without cropping the image, as a GoPro does when select narrower fields of view.

## Conclusion

However, advanced and compact mode of videography get introduced, the camcorders has its advantages that cannot be ignored. Despite its cons, the camcorders cannot be replaced by any other tool. Analyze the pros and cons to choose the best one and make your event a success.
