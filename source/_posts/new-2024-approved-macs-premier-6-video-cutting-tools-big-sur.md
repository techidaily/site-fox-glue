Released in November 2020, **macOS Big Sur** is the latest OS version for Mac systems. The operating system is equipped with tons of features and has an optimized algorithm for running apps. Sadly, a lot of existing apps are no longer compatible with it and users often find it hard to pick a decent video editor Big Sur app. Donâ€™t worry, in this post, I will make you familiar with the 6 best video editing apps for macOS Big Sur that you can consider trying.
