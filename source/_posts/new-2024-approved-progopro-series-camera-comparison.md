#### **Design:**

In terms of handling, ruggedness and housing both these models are comparatively equal. Both models possess almost equal dimensions and are well known for their built in type rugged protection. The waterproof body can serve you up to 33 feet or 10 meters below water even without any additional housing arrangement. They fit perfectly in the same sized frames and you necessarily need to attach this frame whenever it is required to mount cameras on certain surface because there is no other medium to attach them with mounting.

#### **Image Quality:**

Hero5 session can record photos with 10MP resolution where images will be measured as 3648 by 2736 and they have breathtaking clarity but in case of Hero session this resolution is limited to 8MP only and pixels in image use to be around 3264x2448 only. With the cheaper model you can also adjust camera settings to crop mode take takes pictures at 5MP.

#### **Video Quality:**

If we talk about video quality then Hero5 session is assumed to have much better results with lots of modes and settings available. Some features that Hero5 session has but are missing in Hero Session are:

1. The 4K resolution where cheaper model is able to reach only up to 1080p with 60fps frame rate.
2. The frame rates also differ by great level so speed varies.
3. In camera stabilization is an essential feature; it is essential for action camera lovers because this facility help to save video quality from jerks or jumps.
4. If we talk about field of view then in case of Hero5 session you can enjoy 5 different options in terms of: Narrow, Linear, Medium, Wide and SuperView whereas in case of Hero4 Session you can enjoy recording only with Wide and Medium mode.

#### **Other Features:**

1. **GPS:** Both of these Cameras lack in GPS capabilities. Currently this feature is only available in [Hero5 Black](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).
2. **Voice Control:** This feature is specifically dedicated to Hero5 models and Hero session does not possess it. Actually with Voice control commands users can easily initiate the basic recording functions or take photos even without using hands. Such voice commands are really useful when you are driving or diving and wish to capture scenes all around. If you are searching for this feature then it is good to switch to Hero5 models.
3. **Image Stabilization:** This feature is included in Hero5 Session but is missing from Hero Session. It helps users to avoid distortion in videos due to shakes or jerks on the way while driving or hiking.
4. **Wind Noise Reduction:** If you go for Hero5 Session then you will be able to protect your videos from wind noise and audios will have much better clarity after processing but in case of Hero Session you will miss this feature.

#### **Conclusion:**

Both cameras are quite amazing and all features are much impressive. It is good to consult professionals before investing on any of these devices and also check your budget as well as need. Hero5 Session is suitable for adventure lovers who use to spend most of their time in exploring different locations.
