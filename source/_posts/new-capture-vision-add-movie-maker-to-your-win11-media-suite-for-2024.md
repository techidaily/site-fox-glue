## Capture Vision: Add Movie Maker to Your Win11 Media Suite

Microsoft's video editing tool, movie maker, which debuted 19 years ago, did not find the kind of success Microsoft had hoped for, and as a result, the firm was forced to stop supporting it.

However, the demise of the 19-year-old program opened the door for alternative **movie maker windows 11**, which is included with Windows 11.
