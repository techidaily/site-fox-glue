iPhone users or any other device, capturing every essence of life and watching them closely can rejuvenate your routined dull life. Often a video gives access to small happiness that you left behind with time. Don’t you think it would be a great idea if you could zoom videos on every device? Zoom video on iPhone feature is a great one that enables you to watch the faces and expressions and capture closely, which is truly a visual treat.

* [Part2: How to Zoom in and Zoom out](#part2)
* [Part3: Third-Party Apps](#part3)

## Part1: Why You Need to Zoom in/out

For a long time, only the photo could be zoomed in/out on iPhone. If users wanted to record a zoom video on iPhone that was not possible. But, with the coming of iPhone 7 Plus, users can zoom in/out while recording. If you want to record something that is far from you, zoom in can give you a clearer vision of the object and also let you watch using the zoom for iPhone later, which makes it highly desirable.

The iPhone 8 Plus offers up to 10x digital zoom while you compose the images and the best part is zoom for iPhone is now just a one hand circular swipe and done. Do you know how to zoom video on iPhone 8Plus? Let’s learn:

* Swipe the slo-mo option or video after opening the camera app
* Increase zoom by swiping left and decrease zoom by swiping right after tapping on the 1x button
* The first is to single-tap your display for a 2x optical zoom
* The second method is to touch and hold your display to scroll through your zoom until you get it where you want it
