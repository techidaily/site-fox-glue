Different software are equipped with this feature. However, Aurora HDR is one of the leading choices when it comes to HDR editing. Other programs such as Luminance, Adobe Premiere, and [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are some alternatives to Aurora.

All these software bring forth different aspects of HDR editing, so depending on the article's features, you can choose the one that suits you best.
