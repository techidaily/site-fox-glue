#### Video Quality

SJCam has added its best efforts to offer all good features within one tiny action camera unit. But the biggest fact to discuss about its video quality is the interpolated 4K offering.

## Conclusion

After watching all these incredible features, there is no doubt to say that SJ6 cam offers incredible service with its all good design abilities. The LCD panel assists in better control to all camera settings. The most interesting thing is that users can access all recording modes for underwater shooting too and they always lead to eye catching performance whether you are in air or moving inside a car. The only trouble you will find is its low audio quality but all other incredible features are capable enough to cover that aspect. With payment of only $149, you will definitely enjoy lots of impressive features.
