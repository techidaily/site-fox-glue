 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

If you are just getting started in the world of videography and photography, you may be curious about your options. What is the [best camera for beginners](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to use? Can you find the best entry level camera without spending a lot of money on it?

In this article, we are going to share what you need to look for in a great camera. Plus, we’re going to help you look at the different digital cameras for beginners so that you can find one that is right for you and your needs.

## Part 1: How Do I Choose a Camera

There are hundreds of cameras available to choose from. How do you know which one is going to be right for your purposes? Here’s a quick look at some of the most important traits that you’ll want to keep an eye out for during your search.

* **Portability**: If you want to make sure that you can take your camera with you everywhere, then a simple point and click option may be perfect for what you’re looking for. While these typically have a fixed lens, the technology for these cameras have gotten a lot better at providing flexibility and excellent results, as well. In many cases, beginners benefit from using a simple [point-and-click camera](https://www.digitaltrends.com/photography/best-point-and-shoot-cameras/) at first.
* **Budget**: You always want to be sure that you look at price when you’re looking at beginner cameras. More often than not, you’re going to want to get something that is relatively affordable without sacrificing quality. You may not know whether or not you want to pursue this whole picture and video hobby, and a cheaper camera will make it easier to sell if you find it’s not for you.
* **Lenses**: If you’re someone that is looking to step into something a little more complicated, you may also want the flexibility to [switch out the lenses](https://lifehacker.com/the-fastest-way-to-change-lenses-on-your-dslr-1191321251) that you’re using. Point and click cameras typically don’t have this capability, but you can still find some reasonably affordable options that allow for you to switch lenses in and out.

## Camera Options for Beginners

### 3\. EOS Rebel T7

![EOS Rebel T7](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/eos-rebel-t7.JPG)

**Specifications:**

* 1 Megapixels

* Wi-Fi and NFC technology built-in
* 9 point autofocus system

* 3 inch LCD screen

The EOS Rebel T7 is an excellent way for people who typically [share pictures via their mobile devices](https://www.dummies.com/photography/cameras/canon-camera/transfer-photos-canon-rebel-t61300d-smart-device/) to take those pictures with a high-end camera. The fast autofocus, high-end sensor, and wireless connectivity allow for you to get the perfect shot every single time that you’re out and about.

**Pros:** The EOS rebel T7 can shoot rolls, stills, and video. It has easy to use Wi-Fi capability and has excellent autofocus and solid zooms. It’s also built well, so it’s a tremendous substantial-duty option for a camera.

**Cons:** It has a fixed lens, and you can only use Canon flashes and lenses with this particular camera. It also doesn’t have Bluetooth capability, so you aren’t going to be able to use a remote camera trigger unless it’s USB connection to the device.

### 4\. Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark II Mirrorless Camera

![Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark II Mirrorless Camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/olympus-om-dE-m10-mark-ii.JPG)

**Specifications:**

* OLED electronic viewfinder with up to .62X magnification available.
* 5 Axis Image stabilization
* Autofocus with multiple focusing points.
* Silent mode disables any noises
* 5 frames a second

If you’re looking for a camera that is both sophisticated and simple to use, then the Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark II is a straightforward option that you can utilize. Both professionals and novices can utilize the Mark II because of how simple it is to use and how intuitive the setup is.

**Pros:** If you’re using this camera, it has a low upfront cost to it. [Multiple lenses work with the camera](https://www.switchbacktravel.com/best-lenses-olympus-omd-em5-mark-ii), and the “retro” design also makes it a very heavy duty. Both pictures and videos look crisp and smooth, and you’ll get high-quality results every time you use it.

**Cons:** The battery life isn’t the greatest; most users recommend that you get an extra battery (which are reasonably affordable). The camera isn’t huge, and moving targets may get blurry, even with the autofocus. Some people find the navigation screen confusing; others do not.

### 5\. Fujifilm X-T10 Silver Mirrorless Digital Camera

![Fujifilm X-T10 Silver Mirrorless Digital Camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/fujifilm-x-t10-mirrorless.JPG)

The Fujifilm X-T10 is designed for the photographer that is on the go. With multiple menu options and easy-to-use settings, you’re able to customize this camera and use it for whatever sorts of pictures that you’re looking to take. This camera is designed for functionality, and you’ll find that you can use it anytime, anywhere, due to its compact size.

**Pros:** You’re easily able to change the lenses in the Fujifilm X-T10, and it’s fairly easy to use overall. There are a myriad of menu options available, so you can do filters and colors however you want. And, its small size allows for maximum portability.

**Cons:** Some people don’t like the XC kit lens due to distortion around the edges; others have found that it can be adjusted via the multiple settings within menus. If you’re using the device rather frequently, it is also likely that the auto focus may start to fail after a period of time.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1\. Is Canon or Nikon better for beginners?

In all honesty, it depends on what you’re looking for. Similar models are similarly priced, which makes a choice all the more difficult. Both Canon and Nikon make beginner level cameras – the T7i and the D5600, respectively.

The T7i has a better sensor and ends up being much lighter than the Canon model. But, on the other hand, the shooting FPS and the number of autofocus points are better on the [Nikon D5600](https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/dslr-cameras/d5600.html). So, if you have some preferences related to what you’re shooting or how you want to shoot it, you’ll want to choose one over the other.
