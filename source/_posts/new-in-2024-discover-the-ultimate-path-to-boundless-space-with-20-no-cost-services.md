### No.5 Deego

Degoo is a cloud storage service that focuses heavily on consumers and is primarily concerned with photos and videos. For example, it employs some hidden artificial intelligence to highlight your best images. In direct opposition to Degoo Cloud, Google Photos, Apple Photos, and other services have been incorporating features of this kind.

With only a web app available for the desktop, Degoo Cloud relies heavily on its apps for Android and iOS. There are also apps for Samsung and Huawei app. Although the service has few features, it's worth looking at if you need a place to store your photos.

### No. 17\. LetsUpload

LetsUpload stands out from the other **1TB free cloud storage** providers on this list because it offers unlimited backup space free.

It enables you to stream media directly from your account, share files with anyone, set passwords for folders and files, send files via the built-in email feature, upload files by URL, and copy share links in bulk.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

### No. 15\. IDrive

IDrive is a hybrid solution that serves as a backup service rather than a cloud storage service. As we noted in our review of IDrive, in addition to allowing users to schedule automatic backups, IDrive also includes a sync folder, placing it on par with the other services on this list. Due to its extensive feature set, it takes the top spot on our short list of the best cloud backup services. You receive 10GB of free storage space, which scales up to 10TB on paid plans; these plans are highly affordable compared to the amount of storage they offer.

**Official address**: <https://www.idrive.com/>

**Max free space**: 10GB

### No. 17\. LetsUpload

LetsUpload stands out from the other **1TB free cloud storage** providers on this list because it offers unlimited backup space free. It is much more than most websites offer, whether 10 GB, 1 TB, or 100 TB. You can save an almost unlimited amount in your account, but you won't miss out on any extraordinary features. It enables you to stream media directly from your account, share files with anyone, set passwords for folders and files, send files via the built-in email feature, upload files by URL, and copy share links in bulk.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** the maximum upload size, when the account becomes dormant, ads, FTP and torrent uploads support, and the amount of time you must wait between downloads are some differences between a free and premium account.

**Official address**: <https://letsupload.io/>

**Max free space**: Unlimited
