1. Select your imported video on the timeline.
2. Navigate to the **"Effects"** tab in Filmora, followed by **"Utility,"** and choose **"Motion Tracking."**
3. Place the tracking box over the picture frame within your video.
4. Initiate the tracking process by clicking on the **"Track"**
5. Filmora will automatically track the picture frame's movement and generate keyframes for your video.
