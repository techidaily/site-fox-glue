**X Video Editor app** is an Android-exclusive app that has the ability to create more spectacular and captivating videos. The app has an easy-to-use and simple interface and comes with all the major video editing tools, such as effects, filters, and themes.

X is sometimes called an all-in-one movie editing app due to its wide range of features. The app has many features, like being able to play multiple videos at the same time and convert videos into other audio (FLX, WMA, ASF) and video (VOB, AVI, FLV) formats.

Another exciting feature of the X app is its built-in music library, which lets you choose from a wide range of music to add to your video. You can also add your own music, photos, and effects to personalize your video.
