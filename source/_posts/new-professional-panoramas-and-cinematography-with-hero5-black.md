### Explore the Appearance

#### 1.Replace lens Protector

The best thing to know about Hero5 black is that this device is developed with waterproof body so you need not to use any additional waterproof housing with it. But the drawback is that it makes your lens susceptible to damage and scratches. It is better to buy a replacement GoPro protective lens cover to replace your lens cap. While fixing it, never forget to apply little pressure and then simple rotate cap in clockwise direction for 1/8th turn.

#### 2.Lock the Touch Screen

It is essential to lock the screen while capturing your videos otherwise you may face crash of videos due to accidental swipe on screen. To activate this screen lock function, you simply need to swipe down on your screen and on settings bar press the padlock shaped icon. In order to unlock the screen again you have to swipe down again on screen and then again press the padlock to unlock your screen.

#### 3.Side Charging Door

A portable power bank can be directly connected to your GoPro device while keeping your side charging door open. It can easily extend your video shooting hours from one hour to 8 hours. You simple need to open the side charging door and next pull as well as bend at the same time. It will easily come right off; you need not to apply extra force to do this task.
