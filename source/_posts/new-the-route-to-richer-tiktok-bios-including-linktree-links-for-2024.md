## Part 1: What is Linktree?

Using social media platforms correctly can boost your business significantly. However, most of them don’t allow you to add multiple links in your bio. It becomes problematic if you want to add links to your other social media accounts, stores, and web pages besides your official website. To solve this issue, [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/) was created in 2016.

It is a freemium service that allows you to create a landing page with all your important links in one place. Then you can add the link of your Linktree landing page to the bio of your account on different social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram, etc. It allows your followers to easily access your links portfolio in one place, making it easier for them to visit their desired link.

### Collaboration with TikTok

Linktree has always supported adding your TikTok accounts link to your landing page. In October 2022, TikTok and Linktree announced a new collaboration to enhance the user experience by working on a new feature called “Profile Kit.” Part of the TikTok for Developers Program, it also includes SDK Login Kit, which allows users to log in through their TikTok credentials.

After Profile Kit integration, the TikTok creators will have a more enhanced and engaging user experience on Linktree. Users can now log in to their TikTok through Linktree and display up to 6 of their videos to enhance their profile. People viewing the TikTok creator's profile on Linktree can play those videos without leaving the platform.

### Premium Services Offered by Linktree

The Linktree platform was built to help users fully utilize their social media accounts to increase their reach. It offers multiple services and features to easily manage your links portfolio and enhance your user experience. Below are a few of the key features offered by Linktree.

* **Unlimited Links:** When creating a landing page on Linktree to add your links, you can add an unlimited number of links. It means you can provide a single source for others to discover and access your content across multiple platforms.
* **Multiple Social Media Platforms:** Primarily designed for Instagram, Linktree now supports all major social media platforms like TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, etc. It allows you to connect your Linktree landing page to all your social media accounts.
* **Analytics:** Through its analytics feature, you can easily view which of your links are performing well. It provides viewing and clicking statistics for your link, making it easier for you to remove or improve links with the worst performance.
* **Email and Phone Number Capture:** By integrating a mailing list, you can easily request users to add their emails and phone numbers. The captured contact details can be later used for marketing purposes.
* **Multiple Admins:** If you run a medium or large-scale business and cannot manage your Linktree account alone, you can add multiple admins. You can also add multi-factor authentication to protect your account.

### Pricing Plans of Linktree

It is a freemium service with multiple paid plans. Although basic features like unlimited links, multiple social media platforms, analytics, etc., are available in the free version. In comparison, the premium subscription provides many add-ons. Below is the table for the pricing plans of Linktree:
