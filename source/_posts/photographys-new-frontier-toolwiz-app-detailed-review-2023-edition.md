### **Disadvantages:**

**Paid features:**

Although most of the features in this app are for free, there are still a few that are premium and need to be purchased first to use. Such as using various filters, stickers, and font styles, to get multiple blurring effects and some other most advanced features like these.

**Annoying Ads:**

Also, if you use its free version, you must face its annoying ads while editing your photos. However, to become an ad-free user, you have to pay for it.
