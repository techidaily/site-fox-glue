## Part I. Does Storytelling Matter?

The most important soft skill a person could have in his life is storytelling. If you could include amazing stories in your discussion, then no matter in the field, your words will connect and even, in many cases, inspire others. These days our attention is divided into many forms, so it is not always easy to share ideas or influence others. However, if you know how to tell stories, then people will listen.

Let's suppose that you're informing your friends or family members about a hike that you did last summer. In this case, if you only told them about the raw details, then it's more likely that they won't be much interested.

When you put this information in a story's context and apply its rules 9/10 times, your details will be more engaging. So, yes, storytelling is a game-changer in any situation.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, these were some of our recommendations for storyteller academies. No matter what course you choose, it ultimately boils down to your personal needs and future goals. If you want to pursue story narration professionally, then there is no better place than the Academy of Storytellers. On the other hand, if budget is a concern, then even LinkedIn lessons will suffice. Just make sure to pick yourself a content editor such as Filmora before you start your story narration journey!
