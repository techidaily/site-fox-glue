## Assessing Daily Video Consumption in GB Units

The size of the video depends directly upon the bitrate, the framerate, and the Format. It may differ due to embedded audio, different frame sizes, and Aspect Ratios. Let us take an example of a video:

The Framerate = 30

The Bitrate = 25

The Format = HDV 720

In this case, the total space occupied by this 24- hour video file is 263.67 GB.

The most important factor in measuring the file size is the bit rate. **The Bitrate is the measure of the amount of information transmitted every second**. It is measured in Mbps or Kbps. Following is the table, you can use to adjust the file size with different bit rates and frame rates.

There are two simple methods to reduce the size of your video:

Firstly, you can trim the unnecessary beginning and end parts of your video. It will help you reduce the video size.

Secondly, you can remove the unnecessary audio, if your video looks good without background music, you can delete it to get the extra space. Sometimes, the actions in the video are so powerful that there is no need for audio. In this case, you can remove audio and get space without losing the quality of the video.

On the other hand, a video compressor can harm your data and corrupt your file so, you should use proper software by following these steps to avoid data loss. Let’s move forward and I will introduce a few tools which help you further in reducing the size of your video.

## **Can I Reduce the File Size for a Long Video?**

Yes, you can compress your large video file into a smaller video within a few clicks in seconds. If you shoot a video on your cell phone, you need to compress it before sending it to cloud storage as the original file will take up a big space on the cloud storage. In the same way, if you need to send a file via email, you need to reduce the size of your file as you can only send a maximum of 25 MB file.

You can simply compress your large video file into a compressed or small video file without losing the quality of the final video whether you are using Windows, Mac, iPhone, or whatever the device is.

## **How do Compress a Long Video to a Small Size?**

A properly compressed file can easily be uploaded and downloaded and in some cases, playback will be smoother. This can easily be done without losing the quality of the video. Compressing a video reduces the file size of the video. So, takes less space on your hard drive. For example; a **100MB** video can be compressed into an **8MB** video with no visible difference.

There are two simple methods to reduce the size of your video:

Firstly, you can trim the unnecessary beginning and end parts of your video. It will help you reduce the video size.

Secondly, you can remove the unnecessary audio, if your video looks good without background music, you can delete it to get the extra space. Sometimes, the actions in the video are so powerful that there is no need for audio. In this case, you can remove audio and get space without losing the quality of the video.

On the other hand, a video compressor can harm your data and corrupt your file so, you should use proper software by following these steps to avoid data loss. Let’s move forward and I will introduce a few tools which help you further in reducing the size of your video.
