Users can easily download it from the Fx factory website, and its smooth layout will help you quickly navigate its homepage.

But, in the shutter shock FCPX plug-in, you can directly drop your work, and your clients will be able to preview them easily. After all these steps, when you consider the work done, purchasing the plug-in from the site will let your footage appear directly on your timeline without any watermark.
