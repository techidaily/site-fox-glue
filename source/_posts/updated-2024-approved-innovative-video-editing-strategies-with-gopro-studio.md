![Adding title with gopro studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-video-with-gopro-studio-7.jpg)

#### 6\. **Adding and Editing the video**

 Now, choose the video and add it by dragging and dropping to the timeline. After including the video, you can adjust the speed, fade time, brightness, volume level and many other features. You can also add the night vision feel to the video. As you have done in the importing; you can also adjust the duration of every clip that you are going to add in the video.

The fade out effects are added so that the video will not end suddenly. So, when done with adding the clips then, add the fade out effect to the video.
