## Premium Audio Packs for Visual Storytelling

One of the things that the viewer is looking for are the creativity of the content creator, how to make the video lively and how will the video be catchy to the viewers.

Video is one of the most popular ways to reach people today, whether it’s through promotional content for a business or as an outlet for creative expression. Also think if how the content information really good, you should also think of your editing, most especially the choice of background music to set the good mood in the video and also to your viewers who watches your video. Putting background music to your video’s specially of the silent part of the video will give you and your video a unique vitality. But also remember to be very careful on using background music or sites where you take to use the music for your vlogs because not all the application software has passed YouTube’s partner programmed, your channel might be down or disapproved for monetization.

In this article we’re going to give you an idea on where you can get a free background music without worrying of copyrighted issue.

## Why Background Music is Important

* Music is a huge part of what makes this content so engaging

* Background music is a smooth way to fill in moments that would otherwise be silent
* Fill dead air when you have a visual but no sound.
* Music sets the tone and inspire emotion
* The music can help make a video feel long and sad or useful and informative
* Help to boost the production value and cohesiveness of your video content
* Help connect to your viewers with the content.

## What is Royalty-Free Music?

**Royalty-free music**

Is music that can be used without having to pay royalties. This music requires a one off payment or, as in the case of Epidemic Sound a recurring subscription fee.

However, royalty-free music is not cost free. The term just means that users don’t have to pay a royalty each time they use the music. Royalty-Free music simply helps users avoid the pitfalls that can result from trying to navigate complex licensing requirements.

## Places to find Background Music

**YouTube Audio Library**

If you have a YouTube channel then its good to go, in YouTube Audio Library you can access more than 150,000 free tracks. It also has an excellent search capabilities, including the ability to filter songs by how often they’re downloaded.

Everything on the sire is free to use and download, although Free PD offers the option to bulk download all the MP3’s and WAV files for a small fee. The site is minimal and easy to explore.

Tracks are organized into categories, like Romantic Sentimental, the tracks are label with 1-4 emojis to give you sense of the mood. This is a fun way to scan the listing of music and find it more descriptive than any title.

All the music on this site was created by Kevin MacLeod, who has licensed it all under CC-BY. That means you can use everything provided you give him credit. He even has an attribution template for you to use on his FAQ page. If you don’t want to provide attribution, you can purchase a license.

Licensing is from Public domain and Creative Commons and all tracks are free, but Creative Commons licenses require attribution.

## Selecting the right Background Music for your video

This is always my struggle personally but if you know how to find fit music for your video your enjoying every moment while editing because finding or selecting background music that suits to may video creations is a must to create a quality content.

When it comes to selecting songs for background music, think if it like you’re enhancing your own content by reinforcing some emotion or feeling. There are so many things to consider when it comes to what makes good background music. What’s the tone of your content, and who is the audience?

Consider if you are a Product reviewer or explainer use subtle music to maintain the attention of your viewer to the information and product demo. If you are action Vlogger or doing daily lifestyle Vlog, use clear music to explain and advance the plot.

Remember choose music that speaks to your audience, the more you know about your audience’s age, affiliations, and preferences, the more specific you can be about your music choice. If your viewers cover wide swath of professionals in business, it’s best to play it safe with corporate tones. Classic rock, and ambient music. But if you know that they’re younger hip hop and dance music might be more appropriate.
