## Part 2: How to Add the Radial Blur Effect to Your Photos in Photoshop?

To craft a **radial blur image**, many individuals prefer using [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html).

You can use its color grading tools to manage the saturation, brightness, hue, and contrast levels of your photo. Moreover, you can also add layers to your photo if you want to bring extra dynamics.

Photoshop also allows you to use its pre-built filters for further modifications. With a single tap, you can apply filters to the photos without making them look artificial or low-quality.
