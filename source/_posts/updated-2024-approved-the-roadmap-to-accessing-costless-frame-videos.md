4. Find the "Download" button on the video's details page and click it to save the video to your computer's storage.

### Step 2: Motion Tracking in Filmora

To seamlessly embed your selected video within your digital picture frame, you'll need video editing software that supports motion tracking.

### Step 4: Adjust Details and Export

To fine-tune your Picture Frame Video and tailor it to your preferences, follow these steps:

1. Customize the size and position of your video within the frame to achieve a perfect fit.
2. Adjust your video's duration, speed, or orientation as needed to create the desired visual impact.
3. Optionally, incorporate additional effects or text overlays to enhance the video's appeal.

Once you've achieved the desired look for your Picture Frame Video, it's time to export your creation:

1. Click on the **"Export"** button within Filmora.
2. Select your preferred export settings, such as resolution and format.
3. Confirm your selections and initiate the export process by clicking **"Export."**
