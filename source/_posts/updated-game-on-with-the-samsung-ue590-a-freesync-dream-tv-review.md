## Hardware Design

#### 1.Design Style

![Samsung UE590 4K Design](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/samsung-ue590-4k-monitor-design.jpg)

 When we talk about 4K gaming monitors then Design and Style are always some of the interesting features. Samsung has added lots of creativity in design of UE590\. You will find 1 inch thick bezel with eye catching quintessential silver on black scheme for color. Its body has round edges with black brushed plastic material. One of the most unique features is its stand that allows easy adjustments for positioning of this 4K color monitor. It can offer great viewing response with 170 degree by 160 degree ability. The sad part is that gamers can adjust its view only up to their chest level and hence they need to sit in a stressful posture by keeping their neck downwards while enjoying games for hours.

#### 2.Ports and Connectivity

 This monitor comes with Display Port and HDMI 2.0 port. The great thing to know about HDMI 2.0 is its ability to serve impressive results at 60Hz frequency range while working over 60 frame refresh rate. Further, it can also provide better tuning to third party media devices and graphics. The FreeSync technology in this monitor makes use of DisplayPort 1.2 connectivity that ensures great rendering response for games with higher synchronization. The performance goes much better with HDMI2.0 port as it managed 1ms response time that is big advantage against most of 4ms to 9ms rated monitors. But the sad part is missing USB port in this monitor.
