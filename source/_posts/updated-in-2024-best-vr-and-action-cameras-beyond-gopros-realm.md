Here is a surprisingly well-performing and advanced camera unit for beginners that possesses a 2" wide HD display and can record videos with 170 degree wide angles. For photos, it offers 14MP clarity and also provides easy switching ability between burst and time-lapse modes. This device also possesses Wi-Fi connectivity so that all recording hours can be managed from iOS as well as Android devices. With its excellent battery life, it can record up to 70 minutes continuously.

It is not strange that some users are complaining their Gopros are breaking their videos up into smaller chunks. However, the segments can be rejoined seamlessly with ease only if you have versatile video editing software like GoPro Studio, Wondershare Filmora, or Final Cut Pro.
