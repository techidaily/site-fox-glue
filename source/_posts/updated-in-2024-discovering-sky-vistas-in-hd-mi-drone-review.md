Xiaomi Mi has impressive aesthetics and most of its features are comparable to DJI Phantom 4 Drone.

Even, the propeller guards as well as the gimbal unit are detachable so that you can put this drone easily inside your backpack. The overall weight of Xiaomi Mi is only 149 grams due to carbon fiber and polycarbonate material.
