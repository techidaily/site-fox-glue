## Rapid Revamp: Top 8 Video Speed Enhancers for Android

In video playback, how the content plays out and the playback's speed determines content quality. Many editors add slow-motion effects to videos or parts to create a stylish and top-notch look.

However, this effect becomes a default in the videos after adding it, and users cannot easily deactivate the setting. It can get annoying to deal with when you are trying to play a video, but it starts automatically playing in slow-motion on your video player. Thus, for most users, learning **how to change slow-motion video to normal-speed Android** is important.

In general, there is no built-in feature that allows Android users to change recorded video speed, like reversing slow motion. So, it would be best if you considered third-party tools in this case. Multiple options are usable in this context, and we explain some of the best ones here. Interested? Give this a read.
