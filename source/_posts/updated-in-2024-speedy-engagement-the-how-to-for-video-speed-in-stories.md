### Method 3: Change Speed From Timeline

You can instantly change the speed of your video by selecting a preset option. There are two different options available - Fast and Slow. Each of them has certain speed presets for you to select so that it applies to the selected video.

Step1 Drag and drop the video file onto the timeline.

Step2 Select the video clip on the timeline and click on the Speed(timer) icon that you will find on top of the timeline.
