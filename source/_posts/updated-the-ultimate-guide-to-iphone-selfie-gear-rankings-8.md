What is a bluetooth selfie stick? It is basically a device controlled by the Bluetooth connected remote control. How is the selfie stick paired with the blue tooth device?

Find the bluetooth setting on your iPhone after pressing a button on the stick. When pairing is done, open the camera app and place your iPhone at the end of the stick to click your desired pictures by pressing the remote control.
